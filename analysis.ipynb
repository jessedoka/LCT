Best science fiction I\\'ve read in some time. I just loved all the descriptions of the society of the future - how they lived in trees, the notion of owning property or even getting married was gone. How every surface was a screen. \\\\n The undulations of how society responds to the Trisolaran threat seem surprising to me. Maybe its more the Chinese perspective, but I wouldn\\'t have thought the ETO would exist in book 1, and I wouldn\\'t have thought people would get so over-confident in our primitive fleet\\'s chances given you have to think that with superior science they would have weapons - and defenses - that would just be as rifles to arrows once were. \\\\n But the moment when Luo Ji won as a wallfacer was just too cool. I may have actually done a fist pump. Though by the way, if the Dark Forest theory is right - and I see no reason why it wouldn\\'t be - we as a society should probably stop broadcasting so much signal out into the universe.\", \"date_added\": \"Fri Aug 25 13:55:02 -0700 2017\", \"date_updated\": \"Mon Oct 09 08:55:59 -0700 2017\", \"read_at\": \"Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017\", \"started_at\": \"Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 -0700 2017\", \"n_votes\": 16, \"n_comments\": 0}\\n', '{\"user_id\": \"8842281e1d1347389f2ab93d60773d4d\", \"book_id\": \"18245960\", \"review_id\": \"dfdbb7b0eb5a7e4c26d59a937e2e5feb\", \"rating\": 5, \"review_text\": \"This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \\\\n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I\\'ve read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \\\\\"reactionaries\\\\\", etc. \\\\n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \\\\n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \\\\n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they\\'ve gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don\\'t get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \\\\n I loved this quote: \\\\n \\\\\"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\\\\\"\", \"date_added\": \"Sun Jul 30 07:44:10 -0700 2017\", \"date_updated\": \"Wed Aug 30 00:00:26 -0700 2017\", \"read_at\": \"Sat Aug 26 12:05:52 -0700 2017\", \"started_at\": \"Tue Aug 15 13:23:18 -0700 2017\", \"n_votes\": 28, \"n_comments\": 1}\\n']\n"
