"Mind blowingly cool. Best science fiction I've read in some time. I just loved all the descriptions of the society of the future - how they lived in trees, the notion of owning property or even getting married was gone. How every surface was a screen. 
 The undulations of how society responds to the Trisolaran threat seem surprising to me. Maybe its more the Chinese perspective, but I wouldn't have thought the ETO would exist in book 1, and I wouldn't have thought people would get so over-confident in our primitive fleet's chances given you have to think that with superior science they would have weapons - and defenses - that would just be as rifles to arrows once were. 
 But the moment when Luo Ji won as a wallfacer was just too cool. I may have actually done a fist pump. Though by the way, if the Dark Forest theory is right - and I see no reason why it wouldn't be - we as a society should probably stop broadcasting so much signal out into the universe.",16,5,1,174,32.86,27.51,39.59,65.53,19.33,19.54,85.63,68.97,59.2,9.2,6.9,4.02,1.15,0.57,0.0,1.15,2.3,15.52,9.2,1.15,10.92,13.22,9.77,8.05,2.3,20.69,4.02,3.45,5.17,1.72,1.15,2.3,19.54,1.72,17.82,5.75,3.45,4.6,4.02,0.57,2.87,0.0,4.6,3.45,0.57,1.15,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.47,2.3,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,1.15,5.17,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.57,0.0,1.72,0.0,0.0,1.72,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.15,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.57,1.15,7.47,8.62,0.57,0.57,5.17,1.15,0.0,1.15,2.87,6.9,0.57,2.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.79,5.17,2.3,0.0,0.0,2.87,3.45,0
"This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. 
 It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being ""reactionaries"", etc. 
 It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. 
 But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. 
 I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. 
 I loved this quote: 
 ""In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....""",28,5,1,358,63.49,35.27,64.13,45.44,17.9,23.18,87.99,70.95,58.94,12.29,5.59,2.51,1.12,0.28,0.28,0.84,6.7,17.6,9.22,3.07,14.25,8.66,7.26,6.7,0.56,16.2,6.98,5.59,3.07,1.68,0.56,0.84,13.69,0.84,12.85,3.63,2.23,2.51,2.23,0.56,3.07,0.0,5.87,3.63,1.96,2.23,1.4,0.56,0.0,0.28,0.28,0.0,6.98,2.79,0.28,0.0,0.56,0.28,1.12,3.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.84,0.28,0.56,0.0,4.47,0.84,0.0,3.63,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.28,0.0,1.96,4.75,9.22,0.0,2.23,7.26,0.28,0.0,0.0,4.19,6.42,2.51,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.8,5.31,3.07,1.12,0.0,0.84,4.47,0

"Fun, fast paced, and disturbing tale of murder. Great beach read while in France, which is where its set. 
 I enjoyed learning more about perfume and the power of scent - hearing the descriptions of how different kinds of scents are captured (distilled, oils, etc) was very interesting. I think in general we (certainly I) don't pay much attention to the power that scent holds over us in different situations. I will pay more attention now after reading this. Though I wish I had a stronger nose - curious if there are ways to cultivate that. My wife and I once bought a game at a wine store that had 30 different materials that they use in wine and you had to guess what they were. I think I got 3 out of 30 right :( 
 This was a dark and twisted book though be forewarned - I generally don't like reading first person accounts of murderers - but in this case it was gripping.

"Giving a high rating because I heard the organizer of the Long Now Foundation speak and it was very inspiring. The Interval Cafe in San Francisco is also awesome and has The Long Library in it. 
 The part of the story that I liked most was the power of long thinking. How Oxford College has some gorgeous oak tree beams in their dining room, and they were crumbling, and so they wondered how to replace them. They created a search, and happened to ask the Oxford groundskeeper if any of the oak trees on campus would work, and he said yes, they should use the grove that was planted 500 years ago for that very purpose. So they did, and then planted another grove for 500 years from now. That's the power of long term thinking - how many of us are able to think that far ahead? That story is what inspired the clock, which is getting closer to completion and sounds pretty cool. 
 The book was published in 1999 so I found a bunch of the ideas dated and found myself skimming through them, so only partially read this.",13,4,1,190,44.4,49.45,66.88,69.9,21.11,15.26,90.53,74.21,57.37,13.68,7.37,2.11,0.53,0.0,0.53,4.21,6.32,16.32,8.95,1.58,11.05,7.89,7.89,8.95,0.0,17.37,7.89,5.79,3.16,0.53,1.58,1.05,12.63,0.53,12.11,6.32,3.16,1.05,2.11,0.0,2.11,0.0,3.16,3.16,0.0,1.58,1.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.89,2.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.63,5.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.79,0.53,1.05,4.21,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.11,4.74,7.37,0.53,0.0,5.26,0.0,1.05,0.53,6.32,8.42,4.74,0.53,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.21,4.21,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.53,0
"I decided to give up eating processed sugar for the month of January, and so reading a book with this title seemed like it would help me adhere. And not only did it succeed in that goal, but I think it put a permanent, deep scare in me about sugar. The book basically argues that sugar is the root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even a lot of cancer. 
 What is interesting is while all of us know that sugar is not good for us, the only thing that people officially blame on overconsumption of it is tooth decay. Obesity is highly correlated with diabetes, heart disease, and a number of other bad things. If you Google for the cause of obesity, you see statements like ""Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don't burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat."" This book makes the argument that a calorie is not a calorie, that sugar is actually toxic, but unlike other toxins it takes decades of overconsumption to show up - which has made it hard to prove. 
 The statistics are fascinating. Fifty years ago, one in eight American adults was obese; today the number is greater than one in three. Diabetes has gone from 1 in 2,000-3,000 to 1 in 7-8, which is an astounding increase. The book listed numerous examples of native populations that suffered from a similar diabetes epidemic after adopting the ""western diets and lifestyle"". What is it about western lifestyle that has done this? The culprit is almost certainly something in the diet, and linked to processed foods - and after reading this book, it seems very logical that sugar is either the root or one of the main root causes. 
 ""By the late 1970s, though, sugar had mostly vanished from the discussion. Dietary fat had been implicated as a cause of heart disease. Nutritionists and public-health authorities responded by rejecting the idea that sugar could be responsible for the diseases that associated with heart disease, which included both obesity and diabetes."" 
 The book gives a fascinating history of how nutritionists and the government have viewed sugar as largely harmless. This included an impressive amount of lobbying from the sugar industry to vindicate themselves. Mind-blowingly, the sugar industry back in the 50's actually advertised sugar as a great, healthy way to get calories. Sugar has never, and largely is still not thought of as a root cause of obesity - the narrative is still more about fats and ""lifestyle"" (i.e. lack of exercise). 
 ""To the sugar industry, it has been the gift that keeps on giving, the ultimate defense against all arguments and evidence that sugar is uniquely toxic. This is the idea that we get obese or overweight because we take in more calories than we expend or excrete. By this thinking, researchers and public-health authorities think of obesity as a disorder of ""energy balance,"" a concept that has become so ingrained in conventional thinking, so widespread, that arguments to the contrary have typically been treated as quackery, if not a willful disavowal of the laws of physics."" 
 ""Fat"" is often the culprit named for people getting fat (even the word is the same!), and thus was born a processed food industry that touts ""low-fat"" items (which are then rich in sugar+salt to offset the bad taste). But looking at populations that eat high fat content but low sugar, shows lower rates of obesity and heart disease. For instance, the French. 
 ""When researchers realized that the French had relatively low rates of heart disease despite a diet that was rich in saturated fats, they wrote it off as an inexplicable ""paradox,"" and ignored the fact that the French traditionally consumed far less sugar than did populations-- the Americans and British, most notably-- in which coronary disease seemed to be a scourge. At the end of the eighteenth century, French per capita sugar consumption was less than a fifth of what it was in England. At the end of the nineteenth century, even after the beet-sugar revolution, France was still lagging far behind both the British and the Americans-- thirty-three pounds for the French compared with eighty-eight for the English and sixty-six for Americans."" 
 Interestingly, when we say ""sugar"" we can actually be referring to a number of things: fructose, glucose, or sucrose. Glucose is used to refer to blood sugar levels in blood, and also comes from eating carb rich foods like bread or potatoes. Sucrose is table sugar, which actually made of part fructose. Fructose is the scary one because ""it is very different from other sugars because it has a different metabolic pathway and is not the preferred energy source for muscles or the brain."". Fructose is found in fruit but as such low levels that it isn't harmful, plus its offset by rich fibers. But high fructose corn syrup? Avoid at all costs. 
 The logic is basically: IF excess sugar (fructose notably) leads to insulin resistance, THEN we can say with confidence that it is likely a root cause of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer, as it's been proven to be correlated with all those things. High fat diets - particularly the wrong sorts of fats - are also involved if eaten in excess. The logic seems solid - and yet even searching ""what causes obesity"" you don't see sugar named as a key cause. I'd be very curious to learn from nutritionists what the think of this logic. 
 ""Is it that we're all simply eating too much and exercising too little, which is the one simple answer that the nutritional establishment will embrace in the face of so much evidence to the contrary? Another simple answer, and a more likely one, is sugar.""",26,5,1,986,72.37,20.28,30.53,12.75,22.93,22.62,89.86,69.07,54.56,9.13,2.03,0.51,0.91,0.41,0.0,0.2,7.1,16.43,8.92,2.23,14.1,7.81,5.48,8.32,1.01,13.89,7.91,6.49,2.94,1.12,0.61,1.32,15.31,1.01,14.2,3.35,2.43,0.81,2.74,0.81,5.48,0.0,3.96,1.62,2.33,1.01,0.2,0.81,0.2,0.3,0.0,0.0,4.26,2.43,0.2,0.0,0.41,0.3,1.12,1.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.3,0.81,0.1,1.93,0.0,0.0,1.42,0.51,0.0,11.97,6.69,3.75,1.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.1,0.3,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.61,3.04,5.07,0.41,0.41,3.75,0.41,0.0,0.1,2.64,3.96,5.58,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.55,4.36,5.78,0.3,0.1,0.71,6.29,0
"I haven't read a non-fiction book this engaging in some time. This was an amazingly well written autobiography. It read like a fast paced novel through much of it. Many autobiographies are too long - this one if anything is too short! Like many startup companies, the story of Nike (or Blue Ribbon Shoes as it was initially called) is one of trials, tribulations, and lots of passion and grit. I ate it up, and highly recommend it. 
 The most defining moment of the story is Knights ballsy move while backpacking through Japan at the age of 24, to walk into a Japanese shoe manufacturer and say he has a shoe distribution company, and get a exclusive deal for the western US. Gutsy. He ""just did it"" (sorry, but apt). I love learning examples of this kind of ""Do things that don't scale"" start to successful companies (eg Zappos, Amazon, many more). From there the story is one of doubling sales each year, and never quite having enough money on the balance sheet to make it anything but very risky. It was interesting - no fascinating - that Phil had an accounting background, and was well versed that the reason most startups fail is a lack of cash reserves, and yet he had so much faith in his growth and sales that he kept plowing all cash into growth. I loved reading the stories of how they barely made it from one order to the next, how twice they had to switch banks after being cut off. 
 One of the key strategies of Nike's success today is athlete endorsement, and it was interesting to see how that strategy was formed in the early years. How they would offer large sums of money to athletes to wear their shoes - often to athletes already wearing their shoes - double down on people who already like your product. It was doubly interesting that Phil didn't initially believe in the power of advertising - I'd be very curious to hear how his opinion on that changed over time. 
 The story of Prefontaine was a touching one, and one that stayed with me. I wasn't as familiar of the story of Pre, but had heard of him. But I didn't know the role that Nike sponsored him, and even employed him. Reading Phil talk about him, you got a sense of the passion his has for the sport of running. You got a sense that the story of Pre - his passion and drive - is a metaphor for how Nike was built. This quote says it better: 
 ""For eleven laps they ran a half stride apart. With the crowd now roaring, frothing, shrieking, the two men entered the final lap. It felt like a boxing match. It felt like a joust. It felt like a bullfight, and we were down to that moment of truth--death hanging in the air. Pre reached down, found another level--we saw him do it. He opened up a yard lead, then two, then five. We saw Young grimacing and we knew that he could not, would not, catch Pre. I told myself, Don't forget this. Do not forget. I told myself there was much to be learned from such a display of passion, whether you were running a mile or a company."" 
 The book is a fascinating telling of the founding and early history of Nike. But it stops at the IPO, and then gives a chapter postlude. This is my only complaint. It was so well written - keep going! Tell us the story of Just Do It, Air Jordans, and so many more. I could read 4 more volumes of this, as it feels like there is so much more to they story of Nike to learn.",29,5,1,624,54.98,42.88,35.18,63.12,16.42,15.06,87.98,73.56,60.42,14.58,7.53,2.24,0.96,0.64,2.4,1.12,7.05,18.11,7.85,2.56,13.62,8.01,5.77,6.25,1.76,16.99,5.93,7.05,2.72,0.96,1.28,0.64,10.74,0.48,10.26,3.85,1.76,1.12,1.76,0.16,3.04,0.32,2.72,2.72,0.0,0.32,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.9,4.65,0.32,0.0,0.16,0.0,3.21,5.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.72,0.16,0.0,0.16,0.0,3.85,0.8,0.0,2.24,0.96,0.16,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.16,0.32,0.0,0.64,0.16,0.16,0.0,0.32,0.16,0.96,4.81,8.81,0.32,1.92,4.17,0.8,0.64,1.12,4.33,7.85,3.37,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.99,5.77,5.29,0.0,0.32,1.28,4.33,0
"Kevin Kelly, who is a Wired co-founder, lays out technological trends that are ""inevitable"". Like too many nonfiction books, I found a few chapters to be worth reading, and a few not to be. I enjoyed the sections on AI and books. And sometimes just zooming out to get bigger perspective is engaging, which was the case for me in the sections on VR/AR and tracking. Much of the rest of the book seemed geared for people less technically savvy, which was my only complaint as it really drew the book out. 
 There is a famous saying in software said by Marc Andreeson that ""software is eating the world"". Kelly predicts, I believe correctly, that the next phase of this will be AI: ""It is hard to imagine anything that would ""change everything"" as much as cheap, powerful, ubiquitous artificial"". Kelly's perspective here that while it might feel like innovation in technology is slowing to some, it is much more likely that we are on the brink of the next renaissance, and we will all be ""taking X and adding AI"", much as happened with electricity and then the internet. 
 Kelly correctly identified the three key trends that are making AI an exciting space today: processing power (GPU's), data, and better algorithms. However he didn't dive more into the longest pole: how to get a lot more data than we have today - that seems to me to be the key. But cool to get an overview. He did address one of the big fears about automation that many people have today: will computers take all our jobs? The quick answer is yes, but we'll have new ones. This has already happened multiple times in history. I agree with this, but think the more interesting question is what will happen when we can provide most people the basics (food, water, shelter) for very little cost. This was predicted in Diamond Age, and the answer was ""parking lots and chaos"", and a lot of people with no purpose in life. 
 I also greatly enjoyed the section on books, mostly because (1) Goodreads is mentioned (hey I have paternal pride), and (2) it talks about things we at Goodreads are working on. Such as, the ability to see other peoples notes: ""Reading becomes social. With screens we can share not just the titles of books we are reading, but our reactions and notes as we read them. Today, we can highlight a passage. Tomorrow, we will be able to link passages."" Well, here are my notes from this book! 
 Another big idea that Kelly hits on that I think is big and inevitable is how each book will become networked, much as the WWW has. Once we have ability to have pointers into and out from each sentence of a book, the speed at which ideas will fly out of books will step function. 
 In the goodness of time, as all books become fully digital, every one of them will accumulate the equivalent of blue underlined passages as each literary reference is networked within that book out to all other books. Each page in a book will discover other pages and other books. Thus books will seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together into one large metabook, the universal library. The resulting collective intelligence of this synaptically connected library allows us to see things we can't see in a single isolated book.",14,4,1,572,64.35,46.26,45.4,46.66,20.43,19.06,87.76,70.28,57.17,11.54,5.94,1.92,2.8,0.0,0.35,0.7,5.59,18.18,6.99,1.4,13.99,9.97,3.85,6.47,0.87,16.43,8.92,8.39,5.24,3.32,1.22,0.87,13.29,1.4,11.89,3.85,1.57,0.87,1.4,0.7,3.5,0.0,2.45,2.1,0.35,1.05,0.7,0.17,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.52,2.45,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.0,1.57,4.55,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.52,2.8,0.0,0.0,2.8,4.72,0.0,0.0,4.2,0.52,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.52,7.52,7.52,0.0,0.87,5.59,0.7,0.0,0.52,2.97,2.8,5.42,2.8,0.52,0.17,0.35,0.0,0.0,17.13,4.55,5.77,0.17,0.17,0.87,5.59,0

"Best book of the series, and best book about American history that I think I've read. Now we are getting to the drama and corruption at an interesting scale - the US Senate. And the portrait we have of Johnson is fascinating. 
 Lyndon Johnson was just simply power hungry. He had no principles of note, no things he was on a mission to do - except to hold as much power as he could. But he was brilliant at reading people, knowing what they wanted, and finding ways to horse-trade in his huge and growing network - and help them get it. A genius at being a politician. But lacking principles - I hope there are politicians that can do both. 
 But this is not just a book about LBJ and his time in the senate - it is a history of the senate, and of 1960's America. I didn't appreciate the power the Senate has in US politics - small numbers of senators can block legislation for a long time. The book hints that WWII can be blamed on the senate - because the president wanted to act against Hitler much earlier but the senate didn't let him - a crazy allegation if true. And the filibusters! I didn't appreciate what those really were and how powerful they were. It was also very impressive reading how quickly LBJ took over leadership of the Senate - most senators had to wait until they were old to have the seniority to do much - LBJ within two years of being a senator had become elected leader and then did away with the seniority rule - both unprecedented changes. 
 And of course, much of the book is about the fact that the southern senators collaborated to prevent any civil rights legislation for 100 years. It was well into the 20th century before African Americans got the right to vote, and we removed segregation - and this delay is all due to the senate. 
 LBJ is known for being the president who passed civil rights - but the story of how he was a ""southern senator"" (from Texas) who had the southern senators as his base, but had to pass civil rights bills through the senate in order to make the liberals believe he was on their side so he could have a presidential bid - was fascinating. He did it not caring a single bit about the actual cause - it was simply the only path to be president, as the country had hit a point where the northerners were no longer going to let segregation go on, and the southerners were only going to give it up over their dead bodies. LBJ worked both sides, found compromises, made each side believe he was really on their side, and got the first ever civil rights bill of the 1900's passed to give African Americans the right to vote.",25,5,1,471,67.38,54.01,11.37,42.23,24.79,16.35,91.93,74.1,59.24,10.19,6.58,1.06,0.85,0.0,2.76,1.49,3.61,16.77,10.19,1.49,14.01,10.83,5.1,7.01,1.7,18.9,6.79,5.1,9.13,1.27,0.64,7.22,11.89,1.49,10.4,2.55,1.7,1.91,0.64,1.27,2.97,0.0,3.4,2.34,0.85,0.85,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.98,2.55,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.21,7.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.76,9.55,8.49,1.06,0.0,2.12,0.0,0.0,1.91,0.21,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.21,1.06,0.64,1.06,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.64,4.88,6.16,0.42,0.85,5.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.61,8.49,3.18,1.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.31,3.82,2.76,0.0,0.21,1.27,4.25,0
"A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn't put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: 
 ""I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know..."" ""What?"" ""So fragile."" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, ""It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world."" 
 This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. 
 If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. 
 ""Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice."" Daniela says, ""Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don't cheat the system.""",22,3,1,462,38.06,71.35,62.76,25.84,12.83,17.75,91.56,73.16,58.87,16.88,8.23,2.6,1.95,3.25,0.43,0.0,8.66,17.75,8.23,0.87,11.9,9.96,6.71,5.63,1.52,19.26,5.63,3.68,4.76,3.03,1.08,0.65,20.56,2.38,18.18,5.63,1.73,4.55,2.81,1.73,2.6,0.0,6.06,3.25,2.81,3.03,1.08,1.95,0.22,0.0,1.73,0.0,9.96,1.95,0.22,0.0,0.22,0.65,0.87,6.93,0.22,0.22,0.43,0.43,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.22,3.68,0.43,0.0,3.25,0.0,0.0,1.3,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,0.22,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22,1.08,7.79,10.17,0.22,1.08,8.66,0.22,0.0,0.22,4.33,4.98,6.06,1.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.18,7.58,3.9,0.65,0.0,2.16,3.9,0

"A fun, humorous, fast-paced, and fascinating take on what happens when an AI awakens. In order to tell this story, Reid invents a fictional Silicon Valley company called Pluttr, which seems sort of like a mashup of Snapchat+Facebook+WeChat but with more big data about us all, so it's able to really personalize it's experience. Frankly it seems like a good idea and where the afore mentioned companies are likely going. And this is one of my favorite things about good science fiction - it predicts the future. While not everything about this novel will come true, it is clear that Reid - who is a former tech CEO himself (and disclosure, a friend) - did his homework about technological trends and weaves them in nicely to a thrilling singularity story (Note: the book doesn't use the word ""singularity"" at all, in a homage to current silicon valley trends, because for some reason that I get but don't quite understand that word is passe - but instead to renames it ""the omega point""). 
 One of the most interesting aspects of the book for me is the fictional company Phluttr. I mean, when an AI finally awakens you'd have to put your money on Google doing it (if it happens in the private sector) - they are the furthest along in the intersection of having the key ingredients: lots of data about people, AI technology, and computing power. But I suppose it would be weird to use a real company - Dave Eggers The Circle was similar in describing a company that was basically FB+Google. But as I said, it does seem like the descriptions of Phluttr will happen, once the both the AI improves (pretty much possible now), the dataset known about each user vastly increases (happening in some pockets), and computing power improves (will be there soon). And thinking through the possibilities of what that will enable was super fun. For instance, there was an scene in the beginning of the book where Phluttr deduced that two of the characters were at the same bar and likely there on a date, and gave them coupons and messages/information appropriate to that deduction. 
 One of the more interesting philosophical questions tackled by the book is: should we try to accelerate creation of a super AI? Since the first one created will have a decisive advantage and any other super AI's created will never catch up to its intelligence nor power. Many think that the creation of a super AI is inevitable anyways, and there is a chance that whoever creates it may retain some control or benefit - though there is a very high risk you wouldn't - which is the debate. The book has characters that take both sides of this question, but ultimately lands that major countries (US, China, others) will get into an ""arms race"" and strive to create it. Doesn't seem unlikely. AI in general (regardless of a super AI) will be the next nuclear arms race, no question - already is if you look at all the hacking and security issues (eg US presidential election). 
 But don't let my introspections about the subject matter make you think this is a deep thinking AI book. It is a fast paced, fun thriller with a twist at the end. It's also got a good amount of self-deprecating-silicon-valley humor - eg I loved the fictional persuadif.er blog, with posts such as ""Eat on the phone"" and then you find poor characters like Pugwash doing just that. Or fun references thrown in like how Tim Tebow is now a VR tycoon (huh?). Bottom line: this captures interesting technological trends in a humorous & thrilling read - highly recommended!",16,5,1,610,66.38,27.53,49.37,88.6,27.73,20.66,88.2,69.02,54.75,10.66,4.1,1.31,0.66,0.98,0.33,0.49,6.56,18.03,10.0,1.15,11.97,8.2,6.23,6.39,1.48,15.25,7.7,4.75,4.92,0.66,2.13,2.3,14.1,0.98,13.11,3.61,1.64,0.66,3.93,0.66,4.1,0.0,5.08,4.92,0.16,2.13,2.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.38,3.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.95,2.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,3.93,0.33,0.0,3.61,3.61,0.82,0.16,2.62,0.16,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.33,0.16,0.98,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.33,2.13,5.41,6.72,0.33,1.48,4.92,0.16,0.0,0.0,3.61,2.79,5.25,2.46,0.49,0.33,0.0,0.33,0.0,18.36,3.44,4.26,0.33,0.16,1.64,8.52,0

"A fascinating look at the early part of LBJ's life and career. This is the first of a four book series covering LBJ's life. At least 3 extremely smart people that I respect told me that this series was one of the best books they've ever read. I was also interested in reading about politics and corrupt politicians to get some grounding given the current political climate, and even in volume 1, this didn't disappoint. 
 Many biographies spend way too much time on details that are not very relevant, especially in the early life, and this book was no exception - although I found the writing good and story compelling that I finished it rather quickly (also thanks to whispersync with Audible). The book covers Johnsons childhood up through age 32 when he as a congressman lost the race for senate to Pappy O'Daniel. Pappy O'Daniel by the way, sounds like fun character - totally unqualified to be governor or senator but elected b/c everyone knew him from his radio show. In terms of Johnsons childhood, it was oddly interesting to learn about the ""Hill Country"" of Texas and why those who have lived there have had such rough lives. 
 I love biographies, as it's always fascinating to see what motivates successful people - where their drive comes from. With LBJ, Caro paints his motivation as initially coming from not wanting to grow up poor and in debt like his father. But then his motivation shifts to become more ""a hunger for power in its most naked form, for power not to improve the lives of others, but to manipulate and dominate them, to bend them to his will."" 
 Johnson's raw hunger for power, his desire to be someone, led him to work extremely hard. And not only himself, but also the people who worked for him. It was impressive how hard he worked himself and his small team when he was working as a congressional aide. And all driven by a lust for power. Interestingly to me, he picked exclusively people who were ""loyal"" to him - meaning he could work them to the bone - over people who were intelligent or experienced in what needed to be done. He was able to pull this off as in the post great depression era, a lot of people had no other way to get a job, or get ahead, and so LBJ had leverage. But LBJ did have a gift in picking and reading men, which was I think key to understanding his success. 
 ""if Lyndon Johnson was not a reader of books, he was a reader of men-- a reader with a rare ability to see into their souls."" 
 And he was not only a reader of men - he could also remember everything about the people he met - he could impressively remember details about a persons son 10 years after meeting them. Great skill for a politician to have! He also had an uncanny ability to make older men look at him like a son - a skill he used with Speaker of the house Sam Rayburn, which greatly helped his career. 
 Johnson also had no qualms cheating to steal elections - with both his election to school president in college, and the little congress, he cheated. 
 A fascinating piece of LBJ was that he worked very hard to not commit to a public position on almost anything. He basically told people what he thought they wanted to hear - perhaps a hallmark of a corrupt politician. This gave him a lot of freedom to play both sides. Liberals literally thought he was liberal and conversatives thought he was conservative. Not the most moral of stances, but in that pre-internet age, more possible to pull off and even smart tactically. 
 ""Once, a congressional aide, who had just heard him ""talking conservative"" with Martin Dies, came across him, ""not an hour later,"" ""talking liberal"" with Patman-- espousing a point of view diametrically opposite to the one he had been espousing sixty minutes before."" 
 A hallmark of the New Deal was helping people who needed it, and Johnson did help the poor farmers of Texas. I thought this quote was a powerful representation of the impact he had and why he kept getting elected:

"A fascinating book about community and belonging, and how modern society has moved us away from our roots in potentially signifiant ways. The book opens with a thought provoking fact: in early America, there were numerous instances of white people joining primitive, native Indian societies - but zero instances of the opposite, because ""the intensely communal nature of an Indian tribe held an appeal that the material benefits of Western civilization couldn't necessarily compete with."" 
 The book also argues that the wealth we enjoy in modern society is isolating, against the grain of millions of years of our evolution, and can lead to depression, because our happiness is in large part rooted in a need to feel connected to others. While this feels right and intuitive, it doesn't seem to be the way we are optimizing our lives. 
 ""A wealthy person who has never had to rely on help and resources from his community is leading a privileged life that falls way outside more than a million years of human experience. Financial independence can lead to isolation, and isolation can put people at a greatly increased risk of depression and suicide. This might be a fair trade for a generally wealthier society-- but a trade it is."" 
 Another loss the book points out is the loss of the transparency and social justice that being in a small community used to bring. When your neighbors and community members all know each other and what is going on with each other, group peer pressure tends to reward good actions and punish bad ones. The book points out that people wouldn't for instance cheat unemployment if their neighbors were paying for it and everyone knew what was happening. In anonymity we have lost a sense of responsibility to each other. 
 Another data point about the power of human connection that a disaster, such as a war, can bring to a society. Junger talked about this in a recent guest post on the Goodreads blog, saying ""Time and time again in history, civilians have forged incredibly strong bonds in the face of wars and earthquakes and floods and gone on to miss those heady times of cooperation. Also demonstrating the power of bonding is the fact that one of the most devastating thing a soldier can face is the loss of a buddy. ""Interestingly, a strong bonding experience can also lead to social change - for instance: ""The coming-together that societies often experience during catastrophes is usually temporary, but sometimes the effect can last years or even decades. British historians have linked the hardships of the Blitz-- and the social unity that followed-- to a landslide vote that brought the Labour Party into power in 1945 and eventually gave the United Kingdom national health care and a strong welfare state."" 
 The book basically concludes that the largest cost or risk of modern society is the loss of community. This is something worth giving a lot of thought in terms of our priorities.",30,4,1,496,87.15,75.49,35.88,25.43,27.56,23.59,91.13,65.93,52.82,8.06,2.62,0.0,1.81,0.2,0.2,0.2,5.44,18.95,10.69,1.01,14.72,7.06,4.23,6.85,0.81,13.31,6.45,4.84,10.89,5.65,1.21,5.04,12.3,0.6,11.49,2.42,2.22,2.02,2.22,0.4,3.43,0.0,5.24,2.82,2.42,1.01,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,13.51,3.83,0.6,0.0,0.2,0.2,1.21,8.47,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.4,2.62,1.41,1.01,0.2,5.04,0.0,0.4,2.42,2.42,0.2,1.41,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.4,1.21,0.4,3.63,8.67,1.01,1.61,5.24,0.2,0.0,0.6,5.65,3.43,5.44,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.29,3.63,3.23,0.0,0.0,0.6,3.83,0
"My first Scalzi book - and really enjoyed it. Delightful well written science fiction book set in the future in a time when humanity is spread out across space and can travel between planets using ""the flow"". 
 I liked how this universe was entirely designed around one huge natural resource (the flow). The entire balance of power was created because the people who controlled the most valuable planet (Hub) started out as armed toll collectors. And from there they shared power with anyone who could contest them, and thus created lots of other Houses and Guilds. With this power dynamic established, the book then delves into the question of what happens if the main natural resource should change. 
 One other thing that I liked even though it was minor to the book was how the emperox's all had all themselves recorded for their entire lives - all neurological happenings in their brains. This lets you create an AI against that dataset that let's you sort of recreate their personality. This idea is interesting, though I think if it did exist it would be much more transformative than it was represented in the book. However makes you wonder if people aren't already starting to do things like this.",18,4,1,205,34.12,54.61,75.67,73.61,20.5,20.98,89.76,72.68,60.0,16.59,8.29,1.95,0.98,1.46,0.0,2.93,8.29,18.54,6.83,1.46,11.71,8.78,6.83,7.8,0.49,17.07,7.32,7.32,5.37,1.95,1.46,1.95,19.02,1.46,17.56,4.88,3.41,1.95,3.9,0.98,5.37,0.0,3.41,3.41,0.0,0.98,0.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.27,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.98,7.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.49,3.41,0.0,0.49,2.93,0.0,0.0,1.46,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.93,4.88,8.29,0.0,1.46,6.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.41,8.29,4.39,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.71,4.88,1.46,0.0,0.0,1.46,3.9,0
"I haven't read a ton of ""history of the world"" books, but this was fascinating. Highly recommended. I think the author is incredibly good at explaining and simplifying big concepts. He take on complex things like religion & capitalism and explains them in very simple terms that you likely hadn't thought about before. 
 The history of religion chapter was very interesting. I hadn't thought about the fact that many early religions were animists or polytheists, or dualists. Nor the fact that they all sort of merged into todays concepts: 
 ""monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts."" 
 There was a fascinating bit on the scientific mindset, and how it was key to Europe taking power. After the scientific revolution, they believed in science and its ability to let man discover new things, make more money, etc. This made them into explorers, whereas many other cultures remained very static. Great example of China having had gunpowder for hundreds of years but not using it for anything other than fireworks, and didn't invent the gun. Reminded me a bit of the Mindset. 
 The chapter on capitalism was fascinating. There line about before its invention that the economy didn't grow, and was ""frozen"" as nobody poured money into new things, so there was no growth. Then the notion of credit was discovered, and as growth started, the combination snowballed. In 1500 the annual per capita production was $550 and today its $8,800 - this is an astounding increase, and all because of the virtuous growth cycle of capitalism: money is invested -> businesses grow -> people make money -> they invest their money. I never thought about the fact that reinvesting profits is a core piece of capitalism, but from this lens it really is. 
 ""The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years - such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep."" 
 What I didn't see coming is how the end of the book was dedicated to human happiness. Fascinating questions to ask if we are happier today than 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. By metrics of death rate, average age of death and general health, we ought to be. But clearly peasants after the agricultural revolution were on average less happy than they were before as hunter-gatherers. And now we live in an always-on internet age, with pressure to continue growing our economy. So are we happier? It is the right question, in my opinion. The book then gave the basics of the happiness framework that I've also read in other places and believe in: that people are happy when they have 3 things: (1) Friends and family that love them (2) Are part of a community that makes them feel like they below (3) have a purpose to their life and feel like they are doing something meaningful. However, the book then adds onto this in another way that I have been learning about but hadn't put together with this: meditation. 
 ""According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices."" 
 So the moral of the book is basically that we should all meditate a lot, stop worrying, and be happy with what we have.",68,5,1,696,50.11,20.77,86.83,58.47,19.89,24.86,89.94,70.26,56.47,12.07,5.17,1.29,1.15,0.14,0.14,2.44,6.9,15.37,7.47,1.58,14.37,8.33,5.46,9.91,2.59,15.37,6.61,4.89,3.02,1.72,0.72,0.57,16.67,1.29,15.37,4.89,1.58,0.43,2.44,0.57,6.03,0.14,5.89,4.17,1.72,2.87,1.58,1.29,0.43,0.0,0.14,0.0,7.04,1.87,0.29,0.14,0.0,0.29,0.43,4.89,0.0,0.14,0.0,0.29,1.72,0.86,0.14,0.72,5.32,0.57,0.0,2.3,1.72,1.29,1.29,0.72,0.14,0.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43,0.0,0.29,0.29,0.0,0.14,0.0,0.14,0.14,2.16,6.03,8.62,0.57,1.01,5.89,0.14,0.0,1.29,5.75,4.89,4.45,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.67,4.89,6.47,0.14,0.0,1.15,5.03,0
"I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. 
 It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. 
 The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated. 
 But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: 
 ""Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase ""it is as if"". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense."" 
 Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: 
 Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?"" 
 Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: ""It was a whiny culture, we were finding."" 
 Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. 
 ""We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem."" 
 My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves.",9,4,1,721,41.44,35.3,45.35,45.25,16.77,21.36,89.04,71.57,60.61,14.98,3.47,0.83,1.39,0.83,0.0,0.28,11.51,18.86,9.57,1.25,12.34,9.99,6.52,7.77,2.08,15.95,5.55,2.77,3.05,1.53,0.69,0.83,19.42,1.8,17.61,6.1,2.36,1.11,3.05,2.36,3.74,0.0,4.3,2.91,1.25,0.97,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.49,3.61,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,3.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.42,0.0,0.97,2.91,0.14,0.0,2.64,0.14,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.28,4.44,8.04,0.28,1.25,4.72,0.97,0.42,0.83,1.94,2.36,8.74,0.83,0.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14,18.17,5.41,6.1,0.42,0.14,1.25,4.85,0
"A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.""",35,4,1,255,46.7,58.73,11.05,43.62,17.0,11.76,89.8,74.51,61.96,13.73,9.02,1.96,0.0,2.35,3.92,0.78,4.71,20.39,12.16,1.57,10.98,9.8,6.27,9.02,1.96,19.22,3.92,4.31,1.96,0.78,0.39,0.78,13.33,0.39,12.94,3.14,1.18,2.35,3.92,0.78,3.92,0.0,6.27,3.92,2.35,4.71,2.35,2.35,2.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.33,4.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,1.57,8.63,0.39,0.0,1.57,3.14,0.39,0.39,0.0,0.0,3.92,0.78,0.39,2.75,0.0,0.0,1.57,0.39,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.0,1.18,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,5.88,8.63,0.0,2.75,3.92,1.57,0.0,0.39,1.96,7.06,4.31,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.08,6.67,3.92,0.39,0.0,2.35,2.75,0

"If everyone in the world read this book, the world would instantly become a better place. Mental models, while never perfect, are very powerful tools, and Grant has come up with a compelling, research backed view of what makes some people successful, and others less so. 
 Grant divided the world into givers, matchers, and takers. Through a lot of research, Grant determined that the most successful and the least successful people are often givers, that takers often do well but not over the long term, and the vast majority of people are matchers. Like all such categorizations (eg fixed vs growth mindset), it isn't perfect, which bothered me a little - until you realize that in different situations you can either be giving, taking, or matching, and there are probably people that favor one of those three more often than not. 
 Grant used surveys to determine if people are givers, though its strange that he didn't expand on what type of questions are used to determine this, as it would have been insightful. Happily, Google works, and I found he does have such a test on his website. And I scored 53% giver! 
 The book opens with a chapter about one of the best givers and people that I know, David Hornik, who funded the last company I worked at. So awesome to see him getting such an amazing shoutout - he deserves it! 
 I liked the example of Ken Lay as a successful taker. ""When kissing up, takers are often good fakers."" I do wonder how many successful ""takers"" there are out there that don't have anything bad happen to them though. The book does use Frank Lloyd Wright as such an example, which is a fascinating dichotomy. 
 Other interesting ways to determine givers & takers: use of ""I"" vs ""we"", number of LinkedIn 
 recommendations written vs received. 
 This was a very powerful insight: ""people actually make more accurate and creative decisions when they're choosing on behalf of others than themselves."". Eg: ""The solution was thinking about myself as an agent, an advocate for my family. As a giver, I feel guilty about pushing too much, but the minute I start thinking, 'I'm hurting my family, who's depending on me for this,' I don't feel guilty about pushing for that side."" 
 The book also explains why givers are also the most unsuccessful - they are too selfless. Successful givers balance giving to others while taking care of themselves. ""As Bill Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, ""there are two great forces of human nature: self-interest, and caring for others,"" and people are most successful when they are driven by a ""hybrid engine"" of the two. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests."" 
 I liked the example of how with Freecycle, small numbers of givers could turn everyone into givers. I think Goodreads has had a similar journey with our community. It's kind of the definition of a community: ""If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and give, even if they're more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get."" 
 Some other quotes I liked: 
 ""highly talented people tend to make others jealous, placing themselves at risk of being disliked, resented, ostracized, and undermined. But if these talented people are also givers, they no longer have a target on their backs."" 
 ""For many years, psychologists believed that in any domain, success depended on talent first and motivation second. To groom world-class athletes and musicians, experts looked for people with the right raw abilities, and then sought to motivate them. If you want to find people who can dunk like Michael Jordan or play piano like Beethoven, it's only natural to start by screening candidates for leaping ability and an ear for music. But in recent years, psychologists have come to believe that this approach may be backward. In the 1960s, a pioneering psychologist named Raymond Cattell developed an investment theory of intelligence.

"I kind of loved this book because it give a lot of the ""why"" - the science - behind a lot of best practices. This is the kind of thing that helps me change my behavior - when I know how it works under the hood. 
 The book is broken into a series of ""brain rules"" on different subjects. I'll list main takeaways: 
 Exercise 
 We all know it's good for us and it feels good and we should do it. The best quote here was ""Physical activity is cognitive candy."" - also ""A lifetime of exercise results in a sometimes astonishing elevation in cognitive performance, compared with those who are sedentary."" The basic science is that blood flow through your brain is good for it and increases brain activity. Tip: exercise before you need your brain to be at its best. 
 Sleep 
 First, great to have validation that there really are early birds and night owls. I'm definitely a night owl, despite my kids best efforts. The interesting implications of this for a company are that people are at their best - their most productive - at different times of the day - so building a culture that is flexible and let's people work their hours is key. The science about the history of naps and the fact that the mid-afternoon slump is a real thing was also very interesting. The studies about sleep loss being as cognitively limiting as alcohol were also illuminating. Another study showed sleeping on a problem really does work. 
 But the most interesting thing about the sleep chapter was the section on dreaming and what it might mean. In particular, dreams may at least in large part be a method of neural network training to enforce learning. ""humans appear to replay certain learning experiences at night, during the slow-wave phase."" 
 Stress 
 Too much stress is bad for you - our systems weren't designed for constant stress. If you have too much adreline in your system constantly it leads to scarred blood vessels and then eventually a stroke. But a little stress is good - our brains will remember things that we are stressed about better (eg avoid predators on the savannah). But too much (chronic) stress can overwhelms the brain and hurts learning and can even make you depressed. Chronic stress is often the culprit in grief, or high anxiety households. The worst kind of stress is the feeling that you have no control over the problem-- you are helpless. 
 Wiring 
 ""What you do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like-- it literally rewires it."" 
 Attention 
 I've said for a long time that humans don't remember facts, we remember facts couched in emotions. We can easily recall all the strong emotional moments of our lives as if they happened yesterday. Now it's great to have the science behind this: emotions release dopamine, which greatly aids in memory and information processing. This means that people will relate better to products that bring up positive emotions for them. It also means that an emotional hook to lead into an idea or product will always work as it triggers the emotion in the person. 
 ""Emotionally charged events are better remembered--for longer, and with more accuracy--than neutral events."" 
 Another interesting thing mentioned in this chapter is the 10 minute rule. We only have about 10 minutes of attention on something before we start to tune out. As the book says, ""This fact suggests a teaching and business imperative: Find a way to get and hold somebody's attention for 10 minutes, then do it again."" 
 To get an idea to stick you have to give people the mental model for it first - ""meaning before details"". Specifically, you need to: ""Give the general idea first, before diving into details, and you will see a 40 percent improvement in understanding."" And then you also have to simplify and hammer home concepts and let people digest them - force-feeding too many concepts at once won't sink in. 
 In terms of paying attention (vs automatic things like riding a bicycle), ""Multitasking, when it comes to paying attention, is a myth."" - the brain can only pay attention to one thing at a time. 
 Memory 
 There are different types of memory: declarative (I can remember my address and SSN), non declarative (I can remember how to ride a bike), short term, and long term. Short term memory isn't converted to long term easily: ""People usually forget 90 percent of what they learn in a class within 30 days. And the majority of this forgetting occurs within the first few hours after class."". Keys to doing so are coding in emotion (why word association works), and repetition (""repeat to remember""). Also, thinking about what tree the person will mentally group the information and how to increase entry points or create strong ones. 
 Interestingly, ""Memory worked best, it appeared, if the environmental conditions at retrieval mimicked the environmental conditions at encoding."". This means if you learn something sad you will remember it better if you get sad again. Fascinating. This makes sense, as our brains must group similar patterns it remembers together. To get practical, you can create science, art, language stations to help people remember better. 
 We all know this to be true - our memory isn't perfect. This is because we remember patterns, not facts or single instances. ""Our brains give us only an approximate view of reality, because they mix new knowledge with past memories and store them together as one."" 
 Another tidbit I liked, that fits in the ""repeat to remember"" bucket: ""A great deal of research shows that thinking or talking about an event immediately after it has occurred enhances memory for that event"". Basically the more an idea can be repeated - especially in timed intervals - the more chance it has of being encoded from short term to long term memory. 
 Sensory Integration 
 We remember data from each of our senses, and we learn best if we stimulate multiple senses concurrently. You remember better if you see AND hear something, or even if given words and pictures. Smells or sounds or tastes can trigger additional associations or emotions and help us create positive or negative associations to things we see or do. This is why people who haven't adopted digital reading say things like ""I love the smell of a good book"", this is why smelling fresh roasted coffee is a key part of Starbucks playbook. Smells have the power to bring back memories that are associated with them. 
 Vision 
 Vision trumps and overrides all other senses. I loved the story about the wine experts who were fooled by white wine with red dye in it because their eyes said it was red wine. Fascinating to read about the science of how the brain takes in the signals from the eyes, combines both signals, and applies pattern matching to fill in details. This means the brain has creative freedom to insert whatever it wants into our vision. 
 Practical applications: our vision is caught by bold colors, orientations, motion. We remember images better than words because it's easier to pattern match the image, so use images in presentations. 
 Music 
 Music makes us more empathic - we can better recognize the emotions in speech, which helps in social abilities. Making music is 10x better for kids than listening to baby einstein CD's. Listening to music reduced cortisol and stress. 
 Gender 
 Boys and girls have different brain structures. When under stress, men remember the gist of things better, and women remember details and emotions. These quotes describe it well: 
 ""The difference between girls' and boys' communication could be described as the addition of a single powerful word. Boys might say, ""Do this."" Girls would say, ""Let's do this."" 
 ""When girl best friends communicate with each other, they lean in, maintain eye contact, and do a lot of talking. They use their sophisticated verbal talents to cement their relationships. Boys never do this. They rarely face each other directly, preferring either parallel or oblique angles. They make little eye contact, their gaze always casting about the room. They do not use verbal information to cement their relationships. Instead, commotion seems to be the central currency of a little boy's social economy. Doing things physically together is the glue that cements their relationships."" 
 ""In our evolutionary history, having a team that could understand both the gist and details of a given stressful situation helped us conquer the world. Why would the world of business be exempted from that advantage? Having an executive team or work group capable of simultaneously understanding both the emotional forests and the trees of a stressful project, such as a merger, might be a marriage made in business heaven. It could even affect the bottom line."" 
 Exploration 
 We learn by doing, by exploring the world. We take pleasure in that exploration. Discovery based learning is best. Medical school offers the best on the job learning - other types of education should do better to model it. Learn and be curious.",38,4,1,1499,61.21,71.64,52.61,35.35,16.84,22.62,90.39,66.64,51.5,12.54,6.2,0.93,2.27,1.4,0.0,1.4,6.34,14.61,7.2,1.07,12.74,7.94,4.67,6.94,0.67,15.08,8.47,5.07,7.4,3.54,2.94,1.27,16.34,0.53,15.68,5.0,2.4,1.47,2.6,0.33,3.94,2.0,6.4,3.27,2.2,2.94,0.6,1.4,0.93,0.0,0.27,0.0,11.67,4.2,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.87,7.34,0.33,0.07,0.33,0.4,0.07,0.0,0.0,0.07,4.2,0.47,0.2,3.07,0.6,0.07,2.87,0.67,0.13,0.13,0.07,0.27,0.07,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.07,0.53,0.0,0.07,0.0,0.07,0.13,1.53,6.74,8.87,0.53,0.8,4.6,1.8,0.6,0.47,4.67,2.87,5.4,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.48,6.0,3.67,0.07,0.0,1.27,6.47,0
"I think this is a must read for any leader in a modern business. Google has done a lot of things right both in their products and also in how they run their company and build their culture, and this is a fairly detailed account of how they've built an impressive culture, and is written by someone who knows - their head of HR. I'm a little surprised he told as much as he did - but I suppose it will only help for recruiting. 
 Goodreads is now a subsidiary of Amazon, and I have spent significant time learning to integrate the best of Amazons culture with ours. And I'm happy to say that many - perhaps most - of the best practices listed in the book are also used by Amazon. Things like hiring people smarter than you, hiring committees and having objective people on them, committees to approve promotions, focusing on the two tails, and more. These don't seem to be things all companies do yet - but should. 
 So while much of the practices were things I'm already doing or aware of - there was a lot I learned from the book too. Here are some of the bigger takeaways I had. 
 One of the more interesting ones was the notion to separate performance reviews from compensation discussions. This makes a lot of sense, is something we have already been making progress towards, and is something I'm going to think about more. 
 ""Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve."" If you want people to grow, don't have those two conversations at the same time. Make development a constant back-and-forth between you and your team members, rather than a year-end surprise."" 
 Another one was giving managers a bi-annual scorecards from their directs on how they did on ~10 dimensions that Google has determined are the determinants of a great manager. And no surprise (but very important to keep in mind), the book found that ""manager quality was the single best predictor of whether employees would stay or leave, supporting the adage that people don't quit companies, they quit bad managers."" While we do a lot of surveys, we haven't packaged up the managers feedback into a report like this, and I think that would be powerful. 
 Laszlo was impressive in citing lots of research to prove his points. It was one of my more favorite things about the book - he is clearly a student of human development. This led to lots of tidbits that apply pretty broadly, and which are great things to keep in mind when building a business. 
 The chapter on nudges was I think my favorite in the book. Pretty cool the depth to which they have taken these - reminds me a lot of the onboarding funnel analysis I've done for Goodreads - paying attention to where you can message timely, relevant, easily actionable messages that will result in people taking desired actions, and a/b testing the results. Pretty impressive they a/b test that kind of stuff at Google! Examples given were around lists on how to onboard someone as a manager, how to be onboarded as a newbie, how to get more people to save money earlier in life and enroll in the 401K program (his data here was impressive - on how people of the same income bracket vary widely on wealth accumulated in their lives based purely on how much they save when they are young), and how to get people to eat healthier by putting the healthier foods in the kitchens more prominently. 
 ""Nudges are an incredibly powerful mechanism for improving teams and organizations. They are also ideally suited to experimentation, so can be tested on smaller populations to fine-tune their results."" 
 Laszlo did a great job of explaining a lot of the psychology behind nudges too. My favorite was the research about checklists, and story about how the Airforce found that even the smartest, best trained pilots can make mistakes, but having checklists reduces their error rates significantly. 
 ""I realized that management too is phenomenally complex. It's a lot to ask of any leader to be a product visionary or a financial genius or a marketing wizard as well as an inspiring manager. But if we could reduce good management to a checklist, we wouldn't need to invest millions of dollars in training, or try to convince people why one style of leadership is better than another. We wouldn't have to change who they were. We could just change how they behave."" 
 ""It turns out checklists really do work, even when the list is almost patronizingly simple. We're human, and we sometimes forget the most basic things."" 
 Another thing I loved was the focus on identifying the people who are best at a specific skill, and designing a program for them to teach that skill to others. G2G (Googlers 2 Googlers). 
 ""Giving employees the opportunity to teach gives them purpose. Even if they don't find meaning in their regular jobs, passing on knowledge is both inspiring and inspirational."" 
 I liked his descriptions of deliberate learning. He gave examples of asking after every meeting ""what did we learn and how could we do better in the future"". And the story about Tiger hitting golf balls at 4am in the rain was pretty sweet. 
 ""Ericsson refers to this as deliberate practice: intentional repetitions of similar, small tasks with immediate feedback, correction, and experimentation."" 
 My favorite tidbit - which I know to be true but is something great to keep in mind - is how to motivate people: let them connect to the people their work is helping. 
 ""even a small connection to the people who benefit from your work not only improves productivity, it also makes people happier. And everyone wants their work to have purpose.

"A decent book about Google from it's former CEO and head of product. I am only giving it 3 stars because a lot of it was too vague to be useful or stuff I already knew. However every 5 or 10 pages there was a nugget, or reminder of something I knew but that was good to think about. Also good to see a lot of this all written down in one place. So worthwhile overall, though it did take me a while to plow through. 
 Eric spent a lot of time talking about product excellence. In todays crowded market, products that are better than the rest are the ones that succeed. Better design, functionality, even speed. 
 ""product excellence is now paramount to business success--not control of information, not a stranglehold on distribution, not overwhelming marketing power"" 
 There was also a lot of discussion about how to lead a engineering and product led organization - which is absolutely critical in a technology company. Also discussion how to scale a company and hire smart people. Eric used the prhase ""smart creatives"" to describe the kind of people who will be successful in a technology company - though I'm not so sure they are such a new breed as he makes out. But anyways: identify smart creative people who like tech. Then find those who have the biggest impact and give them more to do, and lots of autonomy. 
 The below was another obvious-yet-interesting-to-think about philosophy of Google's. A good question to ask in any new product or feature is always what technical innovation it has. 
 ""Basing products on technical insights has always been a core principle of Google, but its importance became even more clear to us in 2009, when we reviewed our product line and started to see a pattern emerging: The best products had achieved their success based on technical factors, not business ones, whereas the less stellar ones lacked technical distinction."" 
 This is another quote that I think is a key to success and scaling a company: 
 ""The simple way to keep recruiting in everyone's job description is to measure it. Count referrals and interviews. Measure how quickly people fill out interview feedback forms. Encourage employees to help with recruiting events, and track how often they do. Then make these metrics count when it comes to performance reviews and promotions. Recruiting is everyone's job, so grade it that way."" 
 Other good tips: 
 * keep details about projects people are doing in your phone address book so you can easily look them up anywhere. 
 * Once a year write a self-review and share it with the people you work with. 
 * Clean out your inbox down to 5 emails or less each day. 
 * In a fast paced business the best/only way to get things done is relationships, so pay attention to those. 
 * OKR's and why it's good to stretch yourself, and make them public. 
 * 70/20/10 for resource allocation: 70% on the core business, 20% on emerging, 10% on new. 
 * The way to improve a product is to challenge your smart people.

"Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). 
 One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive. 
 ""the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war."" 
 Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: 
 ""In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path."" 
 Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies. 
 There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. 
 My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.",20,4,1,423,78.51,24.85,47.17,23.21,20.14,20.33,84.16,69.98,56.26,9.22,2.36,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.47,1.18,6.86,18.44,9.93,2.6,15.6,6.62,8.51,6.86,0.47,13.71,7.09,8.51,3.78,0.95,0.47,2.36,13.48,0.47,13.0,3.31,0.71,1.18,2.6,1.65,4.02,0.0,6.15,3.07,2.84,0.71,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.73,2.36,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.24,2.36,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.71,1.18,0.47,0.71,0.0,2.36,0.47,0.24,1.65,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.47,0.24,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,1.18,3.78,8.75,0.24,2.13,5.44,0.24,0.24,0.47,3.78,8.04,1.65,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.13,4.73,4.73,0.0,0.24,0.95,4.49,0
"I love Stephenson - and this was another hit - absolutely loved it. The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception. 
 It was really two books, and I certainly didn't see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don't have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. 
 The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives. 
 I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting.

"An interesting book that describes Howards return to CEO and the challenges of getting Starbucks back on track after massive scaling and the economic downturn of 2008 left it in a vulnerable position. 
 Howard comes across as someone that loves Starbucks - the company he created. His passion for innovation and coffee and making it work are infectious, and learning a little about his leadership style was very interesting. I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of how Starbucks went astray as it had scaled to over 20 thousand stores, and how he tackled bringing it back. ""The Transformation Agenda"" - because sometimes if you give change a name people will believe it's coming. 
 I enjoyed reading about the campaign to close all Starbucks stores to let employees watch a training video. A big statement, one that was very public, and acknowledged they knew they had issues they need to improve. Bold move, and a respected one. 
 My only criticism of the book is that it comes across as a lot of corporate speak. I'm not saying it's inauthentic, just that the kind of language that he needs to motivate his employees is likely different what what he needed to put in this book. But he's clearly an inspirational leader. 
 Howard spent a lot of time focused creating a quality experience for his customers. He realized that every piece of the Starbucks experience was crucial to building a top tier brand that stood for quality and a place that people would want to spend time at. From the smell of coffee in the store (and the related battle to have or not have cheese sandwiches), to choices people have, to the interactions with the baristas. The baristas were crucial, because with over 20 thousand stores, he had to create programs to train them and make sure they had the right values and approach. 
 I still love my Blue Bottle, but I have more respect when I walk into a Starbucks store now.",8,3,1,328,71.3,56.43,19.67,68.23,20.5,23.17,91.46,68.9,54.27,14.02,7.93,2.44,0.0,0.3,3.66,1.52,6.1,16.77,8.84,2.13,14.02,6.4,3.96,7.01,0.61,16.46,4.88,5.49,4.57,0.0,2.13,2.44,11.28,0.61,10.06,2.74,2.44,1.52,1.52,0.3,2.44,0.0,4.27,3.66,0.61,1.52,1.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.11,4.88,0.61,0.0,0.61,0.0,1.22,7.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.66,0.61,0.3,0.0,0.3,6.71,0.0,0.0,4.27,2.74,0.0,3.35,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.05,0.0,2.13,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.13,7.01,9.76,1.22,3.35,6.1,0.61,0.0,0.0,1.52,5.79,3.96,0.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.28,4.88,3.35,0.0,0.0,1.22,1.83,0

"I haven't read many (any?) books that are written by CEO's for CEO's. If you are a CEO, aspire to be a CEO, or really, manage anyone - you need to read this book. 
 This quote is perhaps my favorite one from the book. At the top, nobody is there to tell you what to do. It's easy to look at some leaders and wonder how they knew what to do to become so successful. Are they just really smart? The truth is that they likely did what everyone else in that situation has to do - get scrappy and just figure it out - and don't give up. 
 ""Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary cofounder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls ""the torture."" Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, ""I didn't quit."" 
 My second favorite quote from the book speaks to one of the greatest challenges all entrepreneurs face: work/life balance. I like to say ""work hard, play hard"". But sometimes it's easy to forget the play part. Or to buy flowers once in a while. But the cost of those on your health or relationships can cost much more. 
 ""As a company grows, communication becomes its biggest challenge. If the employees fundamentally trust the CEO, then communication will be vastly more efficient than if they don't."" 
 Ben had a lot of great advice on how to hire well, especially executives. Looking to avoid reactionary big company execs when you need someone who will come in and get stuff done proactively. Looking for people who can think on their feet and not make everything a nail for the hammer of their prior experience by asking ""How will your new job differ from your current one?"" Looking for people who are mission driven and use the ""team"" prism instead of the ""me"" prism. He also had advice about onboarding, and training. 
 Hiring for strength instead of lack of weakness. I've definitely seen instances of this - where a candidate is great in some areas that we really need but isn't great at everything. Knowing what you value most is critical here - and I fully admit - not easy to do. 
 ""I'd learned the hard way that when hiring executives, one should follow Colin Powell's instructions and hire for strength rather than lack of weakness."" 
 On hiring internally vs externally. Internal candidates across often do better, which is a great thing to think about when building a team. 
 ""when it comes to CEO succession, internal candidates dramatically outperform external candidates . The core reason is knowledge. Knowledge of technology, prior decisions, culture, personnel, and more tends to be far more difficult to acquire than the skills required to manage a larger organization."" 
 One of my favorite sections was ""Managing strictly by numbers is like painting by numbers"". No matter how well you instrument your metrics and goals, you can ever perfectly encapsulate everything you need your company to be doing. Innovation is often like this - with many big innovations the team will often struggle to find how it drives value as it doesn't seem to hit the core metric. But they can all agree it will improve things. I think a big part of the CEO's job is to have a strong product vision, and to not compromise on it. 
 ""I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product."" 
 Ben talked about the difference between CEO's who can set direction for a company (often founding CEO's) and those can can operationally run it as it grows. How great CEOs need to be good at both, and founding CEOs who don't scale are those who don't learn the operational side. And conversely, operational CEOs who don't get good at making decisions about direction will fail. 
 Ben talked about how ""Some employees make products, some make sales; the CEO makes decisions."" The strength of those decisions is built upon having data. Data about what customers think. Data about what employees think. Data about the metrics. A CEO has to be a constant data accumulating machine. Another nuance was that a CEO can make a decision at any point in time with the data they have now, identify what data would change their mind, and seek it out. 
 ""Great CEOs build exceptional strategies for gathering the required information continuously. They embed their quest for intelligence into all of their daily actions from staff meetings to customer meetings to one-on-ones. Winning strategies are built on comprehensive knowledge gathered in every interaction the CEO has with an employee, a customer, a partner, or an investor."" 
 Ben's stories about Loudcloud and Opsware and the Hard Things he dealt with were impressive. I do think they spread too much throughout the book and would have been better concentrated in one part of the book and supplemented by more examples from other companies. But that doesn't detract from one can learn from them. It was strange that he opens each chapter with rap lyrics - that often seem very disconnected to the chapter. I guess he likes rap - but still... 
 Pretty cool Ben had Michael Ovitz as an advisor. And that he modeled A16Z after CAA - where instead of independent agents/VCs, have a shared network - and invest in strategic networks that will help the companies. 
 Michael Ovitz on dealmaking: ""Gentlemen, I've done many deals in my lifetime and through that process, I've developed a methodology, a way of doing things, a philosophy if you will. Within that philosophy, I have certain beliefs. I believe in artificial deadlines. I believe in playing one against the other. I believe in doing everything and anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done."" 
 One interesting tendency Ben points out is that ""When a company starts to lose its major battles, the truth often becomes the first casualty."". You have to be vigilant in looking for the truth, and have backbone spot it. The reason for this, is that ""humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news."" Which is so true! We can always find reasons to excuse away bad news, and reasons to believe good news means more than it should. 
 Ben closes with a quote I really believe in - life is about the journey, not the destination. So you have to embrace the journey. Be so mission driven that the struggles you inevitably face are worth it. ""Life is struggle."" I believe that within that quote lies the most important lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.""",37,5,1,1232,56.61,52.16,42.84,68.77,15.02,22.16,90.42,68.83,55.68,12.58,6.49,2.11,0.16,1.38,0.41,1.79,6.09,15.34,6.98,1.06,13.88,8.77,6.41,5.84,1.62,16.31,6.9,5.28,6.9,1.06,2.52,3.41,17.29,1.14,16.07,4.63,2.03,1.87,2.76,0.81,4.46,0.08,6.41,4.71,1.62,0.65,0.32,0.32,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.08,12.99,3.9,0.73,0.08,0.16,0.16,1.87,8.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.65,0.32,0.0,0.32,8.12,0.41,0.0,7.31,1.22,0.0,0.73,0.16,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,1.14,0.08,0.89,0.32,0.57,0.08,0.49,0.32,0.97,5.68,7.39,1.14,0.65,4.55,0.97,0.08,0.65,3.0,2.19,5.19,1.46,0.08,0.0,0.08,0.0,0.0,17.69,6.49,3.81,0.32,0.08,1.87,5.11,0
"A beautiful story. Neil Gaiman is truly a unique storyteller. I did a combo of reading and listening to this story, and Neil is great at reading as well. I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). 
 I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it's creative, magical, and really, just right. 
 Go and catch a falling star, 
 Get with child a mandrake root, 
 Tell me where all past years are, 
 Or who cleft the devil's foot, 
 Teach me to hear mermaids singing, 
 Or to keep off envy's stinging, 
 And find 
 What wind 
 Serves to advance an honest mind. 
 If thou be'st born to strange sights, 
 Things invisible to see, 
 Ride ten thousand days and nights, 
 Till age snow white hairs on thee, 
 Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, 
 All strange wonders that befell thee, 
 And swear, 
 No where 
 Lives a woman true, and fair. 
 If thou find'st one, let me know, 
 Such a pilgrimage were sweet; 
 Yet do not, I would not go, 
 Though at next door we might meet; 
 Though she were true, when you met her, 
 And last, till you write your letter, 
 Yet she 
 Will be 
 False, ere I come, to two, or three.

"I couldn't put this book down. It was well written - even elegant in a way, as well as though provoking. I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas's for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. 
 Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. 
 If there is a motto of the book, it's probably this quote: ""Because survival is insufficient"". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. 
 ""All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient."" 
 ""Survival might be insufficient, she'd told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare."" 
 The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won't say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I'm glad I'm not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. 
 Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything.

"Recommend this highly for anyone who works in a technology or creative field. Pixars track records is unparalleled - 14 movies and all of them have been massive hits. I had two important takeaways from this book: how to build a great, lasting culture, and how to build a creative company. 
 Catmull's philosophy both around creating movies and managing his company, is to be relentless about remembering that he doesn't know what he doesn't know. In creating a movie, you don't know what it will be when you start. In creating a company, you similarly don't know what it will be, especially at first. But equally importantly when you are scaling it, you don't know the dynamics of what is happening throughout the company - you will have a filtered view based on the (always) incomplete picture you can see. So you have to relentlessly have the mindset to remember that there are dynamics at play that you don't know, and look for them. 
 ""From that day on, I resolved to bring as many hidden problems as possible to light, a process that would require what might seem like an uncommon commitment to self-assessment."" 
 ""I believe the best managers acknowledge and make room for what they do not know--not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur."" 
 So how did Pixar build 14 hits in a row? They created a highly leveraged feedback loop. They created a culture of open feedback, and encourage anyone in the room - regardless of rank - to have an equal voice. They have lots of ways to get feedback on the film and iterate on it: from daily standup every morning to review scenes, up to braintrust meetings with all the best directors and creative minds to review the story. They spend a lot of time - years - iterating on and nailing the story before putting it into production - and even then they keep iterating. Nothing trumps good story. 
 ""Braintrust meetings require giving candid notes, but they do a great deal more than that. The most productive creative sessions allow for the exploration of myriad trains of thought."" 
 ""The first step is to teach them that everyone at Pixar shows incomplete work, and everyone is free to make suggestions. When they realize this, the embarrassment goes away--and when the embarrassment goes away, people become more creative."" 
 ""in Japanese Zen, that idea of not being constrained by what we already know is called ""beginner's mind."" And people practice for years to recapture and keep ahold of it."" 
 I loved the concept of ""the beast"" - which is the trap of needing to continue to succeed a higher and higher levels. ""It is one of life's cruel ironies that when it comes to feeding the Beast, success only creates more pressure to hurry up and succeed again."" An important point to this was that feeding the beast means bigger and better, and taking less risks. To create something new, you have to have the right leadership to shelter the seed and let it grow. 
 The stories about Steve Jobs were great. Made you respect him even more. For taking a huge financial risk to spin Pixar out of Lucasfilms and then personally float it for a long time, taking even more risk. I loved hearing about how much foresight he had with regards to Disney and negotiating that deal. I also loved the story about the wide screen - basically how Steve responds to passion, and pushes people until he finds where it is. This quote explains it well: 
 His method for taking the measure of a room was saying something definitive and outrageous--""These charts are bullshit!"" or ""This deal is crap!""--and watching people react. If you were brave enough to come back at him, he often respected it--poking at you, then registering your response, was his way of deducing what you thought and whether you had the guts to champion it.""",26,5,1,665,55.94,64.91,38.71,72.09,19.56,21.05,89.47,71.43,56.69,13.98,6.77,0.9,0.15,2.41,1.5,1.65,7.22,13.98,7.22,1.05,14.14,7.67,4.96,7.67,1.65,16.84,6.92,5.56,5.26,0.45,3.61,1.5,12.78,1.05,11.58,4.96,2.26,0.6,1.65,0.15,2.56,0.3,5.41,4.21,0.9,1.05,0.6,0.45,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.3,13.53,5.56,0.45,0.15,0.15,0.6,2.41,7.07,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5,0.3,0.0,0.15,0.15,5.86,0.75,0.45,4.21,0.3,0.15,0.75,0.15,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.9,0.45,0.15,0.0,0.45,0.6,2.26,6.92,7.37,0.45,1.8,4.51,1.2,0.15,0.0,3.91,3.16,4.81,1.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.44,4.81,3.91,0.15,0.3,1.35,6.92,0
"What a fun series. I loved Wool, and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up. I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion. 
 It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. 
 There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? 
 Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. 
 What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? 
 The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. 
 I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. 
 If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive. Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.",3,4,1,412,18.97,13.73,55.86,54.14,15.26,13.35,91.5,80.83,63.11,15.05,7.52,2.67,1.21,0.0,0.49,3.16,7.52,17.23,7.77,1.94,9.47,11.41,7.77,8.25,2.91,22.33,8.25,6.31,4.37,1.21,1.21,1.94,20.63,1.46,19.17,4.37,2.18,2.91,4.85,1.7,6.31,0.0,5.58,3.88,1.7,2.67,2.18,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,9.47,3.88,0.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,1.7,5.1,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.49,2.18,0.24,0.24,1.7,0.0,0.0,1.46,0.49,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.49,1.46,0.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.8,7.52,0.0,1.21,4.85,0.49,0.0,1.21,2.91,11.41,2.91,1.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.08,4.61,3.16,1.7,0.24,2.91,1.46,0

"A classic dystopian novel published in 1985, but still very relevant - and even trending in 2017 due to the political climate. I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling. 
 This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a ""hand maiden"" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called ""Offred"" because she is the property ""of Fred"". 
 ""We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."" 
 A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. 
 ""Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some."" 
 This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable: 
 ""We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.""",60,4,1,408,35.88,76.07,32.94,20.23,17.0,22.3,92.89,71.81,60.54,14.22,5.88,0.49,2.21,0.74,1.23,0.74,8.33,14.46,7.11,0.98,12.99,10.29,7.35,7.11,2.45,16.67,6.62,4.17,5.88,2.45,1.72,1.72,19.36,2.21,16.42,5.88,3.19,1.47,3.43,0.49,3.43,0.0,6.37,3.19,3.19,0.98,0.25,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,13.48,3.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,1.72,9.8,0.25,0.0,1.72,0.25,0.74,0.74,0.0,0.0,4.41,1.72,0.25,1.96,0.49,0.0,1.72,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.49,1.96,0.25,0.98,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.74,5.64,6.13,0.74,0.74,4.17,0.0,0.49,0.25,3.68,3.68,5.64,2.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.34,5.15,6.62,0.74,0.0,1.47,6.37,0
"Great explanation of the theory of constraints and operations management. It's a business classic- first published in 1984 - but still relevant as it gets at the fundamentals. I almost removed a star for trying to create a fictional story to tell the book in that was badly told/edited. Did we really need the side story about the protagonists marital issues? 
 One of the biggest takeaways from this book is that it's incredibly important to set the right goals to manage a complex operation. This sounds obvious and intuitive, however it's actually much harder than most people think, and easy to get wrong. It gets down to the question of: is everyone working on the ""right things"". The things that will lead to the business making the most money. It's too easy to find a things that are easily measurable and saying ""this thing is correlated with our success, so let's focus on it"". It sounds like ""cost accounting"" fit into that bucket. 
 ""What you're saying is that making an employee work and profiting from that work are two different things."" 
 So how do you set the right goals? Focus on making money! 
 ""So this is the goal: To make money by increasing net profit, while simultaneously increasing return on investment, and simultaneously increasing cash flow."" 
 One of the drivers of making money in any business that creates a product is throughput, or how fast a product can be made. The others are costs/operating expenses, and inventory. One of the key concepts of the book is that focusing on throughput rather than costs will yield much better results. 
 ""The entire bottleneck concept is not geared to decrease operating expense, it's focused on increasing throughput."" 
 The bottleneck theory, or the theory of constraints, was very useful to think about. My company produces software and not physical products, but each feature we develop definitely has steps it has to go through: creating the concept, research, spec, design, implementation (backend and client), testing, QA, measure results, analyze them, iterate, etc. Focusing on where the bottlenecks are with that process can help us move faster. And every startup needs to be moving fast - and not just at building - we need to be doing build, measure, learn as fast as we can. 
 A consequence of the bottleneck theory that is useful to keep in mind is that in any system only the bottlenecks should be 100% utilized. Every manager will have a natural tendency to want to utilize all their resources to 100% because that just seems... wasteful if you don't. People should be working full time right? But a system can only run at the speed of the slowest bottleneck, so non-bottlenecks will by definition have spare cycles, and it's important to keep them open for the important work and not fill it up with unimportant stuff that will bog them down when you actually need them on the important stuff. 
 I've seen this happen many times in software. An engineer finishes a project, and the big important project coming from the design team isn't done yet, so he picks up something small in the meantime. The next day that big important project is ready to go, but the engineer only needs ""one more day"" to finish this thing he started. And then that day becomes two and then three (because we didn't count QA). And then we've lost 3 days on our most important project for another project that doesn't matter at all. Add that up across a large number of developers, and you've lost a lot of time. 
 The theory of constraints is not limited to manufacturing, as the author shows. In the end, he is advocating it as a method or process of learning. 
 STEP 1. Identify the system's bottlenecks. 
 STEP 2. Decide how to exploit the bottlenecks. 
 STEP 3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision. 
 STEP 4. Elevate the system's bottlenecks. 
 STEP 5. If, in a previous step, a bottleneck has been broken go back to step 1.",23,5,1,670,66.62,47.13,46.31,52.51,14.89,21.94,90.6,70.45,54.78,11.49,3.88,0.45,1.49,0.75,0.45,0.75,7.61,16.57,8.81,2.69,13.73,8.96,4.63,7.01,1.34,17.01,8.06,6.72,4.93,1.79,2.54,0.75,15.97,0.9,15.07,4.18,2.84,2.09,1.79,0.9,3.43,0.0,3.58,2.84,0.75,0.15,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.42,2.24,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.45,1.04,4.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.6,7.61,0.0,0.0,6.72,1.94,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,0.15,0.45,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.9,0.15,0.6,6.72,8.36,0.75,3.58,4.18,0.15,0.3,0.0,4.33,2.54,6.27,1.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.96,6.42,4.93,0.45,0.15,2.54,4.48,0
"Mark Watney is a steely-eyed missile man. A man's man. A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong, and left to fend for himself. I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip, and it flew by - what a fun story. Not surprised at all it's being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon. Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. 
 There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn't double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. 
 But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. 
 ""I started the day with some nothin' tea. Nothin' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin'."" 
 ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped."" 
 ""Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie."" 
 In the end, a well told story of survival against the odds. And one of belief - I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch - you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get.

"An amazing and unique creation: JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst created what reads like a classic work of fiction - something you can easily imagine having read in English class - and then wrote a intriguing side story in the margins. A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. 
 The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I'm reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. 
 The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it's a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like ""relationships"" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. 
 One thing I didn't realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it's an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It's a ship that can't die. Or a series of ships :) 
 I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don't understand it all. But don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka's regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn't really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.",7,4,1,472,62.7,35.22,30.14,56.61,20.52,15.68,87.08,71.4,59.53,14.62,6.36,2.12,0.42,0.85,1.48,1.48,8.26,18.86,10.59,1.06,13.77,8.47,6.36,5.93,1.27,15.68,5.93,3.18,2.33,0.85,1.27,0.42,16.74,1.06,15.68,4.66,2.33,2.12,3.6,1.06,4.24,0.21,3.18,2.75,0.42,1.69,1.48,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,9.32,3.6,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.21,2.97,5.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.48,0.21,0.0,0.21,0.0,4.03,0.0,0.0,4.03,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.85,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.27,6.14,6.36,0.21,1.06,3.81,0.21,0.0,1.48,2.97,3.39,6.78,1.06,0.21,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.04,4.66,2.75,0.21,0.0,2.33,5.08,0

"One of the best books on leadership I've read. Many people struggle to articulate what leadership really is. This book put a more fine point on it, suggesting that leadership is creating change. The author likes the word ""adaptive change"". Once a solution to an issue has been accepted and is in motion, it becomes a management issue - a matter of execution - not a leadership issue. Creating change is not easy: 
 An adaptive change that is beneficial to the organization as a whole may clearly and tangibly hurt some of those who had benefited from the world being left behind. 
 An important point the book made was people can generally only stand so much change at a time. So you have to limit the amount of change you are creating at any given point. A leader also helps people get through the change. They have to acknowledge the change and that it will be difficult, and convincingly paint the picture of why it's worth going through. 
 When you lead people through difficult change, you take them on an emotional roller coaster because you are asking them to relinquish something--a belief, a value, a behavior--that they hold dear. People can stand only so much change at any one time. 
 Another good concept was that of finding the ""orienting value"", and finding ways to drive it home and constantly remind people of it. For instance, Roosevelts New Deal or MLK's I Have A Dream speech. Create an image that people can latch onto and keep repeating that everywhere. 
 To sustain momentum through a period of difficult change, you have to find ways to remind people of the orienting value--the positive vision--that makes the current angst worthwhile. 
 Sometimes, conflict has to be worked out among constituents instead of having a solution dictated. I loved the story about Scottie Pippen disobeying Phil Jackson, and then Jackson saying to the team What happened has hurt us. Now you have to work this out. and then leaving the room. Solutions are often achieved when the people with the problem go through the process of creating the solution together. 
 I liked how the book got into the deeper meaning of life in the end. I've always believed that people need purpose in life, and the authors confirmed that, but warned against getting too wedded to one particular purpose. A useful reminder that the person makes the purpose, not the other way around. We can love our jobs, but it's dangerous to let them define us.",7,5,1,422,77.95,62.54,54.34,45.16,16.88,20.85,91.47,66.82,54.5,11.14,5.21,1.18,0.95,1.66,0.0,1.18,5.92,18.01,11.37,0.95,13.03,8.06,5.45,5.45,0.71,16.82,5.92,3.08,7.58,1.9,3.32,2.61,17.3,0.47,16.82,3.32,4.98,1.18,1.9,1.18,2.61,0.71,6.64,4.03,2.37,1.66,0.71,0.71,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.19,4.03,0.47,0.0,0.24,0.47,1.9,5.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,4.5,0.0,0.47,3.79,0.24,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.13,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.71,0.47,1.18,10.19,7.82,0.24,1.66,4.74,0.71,0.0,0.47,6.4,3.32,5.21,3.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.22,5.92,3.55,0.0,0.0,1.18,3.55,0
"I tore through The Pillars of the Earth, and couldn't wait to pick this up. Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn't a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. 
 I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases. Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor - instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.",2,5,1,188,77.99,34.01,42.1,44.08,20.89,20.21,90.96,71.81,57.45,10.11,3.72,2.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6,6.38,19.15,11.7,2.13,14.36,5.85,7.45,7.45,1.6,13.3,9.57,6.38,4.26,1.06,1.6,1.6,12.23,1.06,11.17,4.79,1.6,2.13,0.53,1.6,2.13,0.0,9.04,5.32,3.72,2.66,1.6,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,10.11,5.32,0.53,0.53,0.53,0.53,1.6,4.79,0.0,0.0,1.06,0.53,0.53,0.53,0.0,0.0,4.79,0.53,0.0,1.6,0.0,2.66,4.26,3.19,1.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.06,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.06,1.6,3.19,6.38,0.0,1.06,4.26,0.0,0.0,1.06,4.79,6.91,1.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.02,4.79,7.45,0.0,0.0,1.06,3.72,0
"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. 
 One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. 
 ""Once a technology has created an association in users' minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers."" 
 I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters! 
 Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc. 
 there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior."" 
 Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it. 
 ""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often."" 
 ""frequent engagement with a product--especially over a short period of time--increases the likelihood of forming new routines."" 
 The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started.",48,4,1,574,75.42,42.11,67.08,84.97,19.13,22.3,87.98,68.47,52.79,9.23,4.36,1.39,1.39,0.87,0.0,0.7,4.88,15.16,9.23,1.74,13.94,7.14,6.79,7.14,0.35,16.9,6.45,3.83,3.66,1.92,1.39,0.35,17.6,0.52,17.07,4.36,2.96,2.44,4.18,1.92,4.18,0.17,5.92,4.88,0.52,2.09,1.22,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.0,7.14,2.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,1.22,4.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.0,1.05,5.75,1.92,0.0,2.79,0.87,0.17,0.7,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.7,0.35,0.87,0.0,0.7,0.17,0.52,0.52,1.05,5.92,9.23,0.52,1.74,5.92,0.52,0.0,0.7,5.4,4.18,4.7,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.33,4.18,3.14,0.7,0.35,0.87,6.1,0
"5 stars for being a un-put-downable page-turner, full of interesting and engaging characters I empathized with, and for teaching me about the politics and religion of the middle ages. Follet is a thriller writer, and it shows. 
 Fascinating that in medieval times, most villages were surrounded by walls (or were inside a castle) - because you couldn't count on the law to marauding rival lords from raping and pillaging your village. And the largest buildings other than the local lords castle, were cathedrals. Why did people spend so much time an energy building these huge monuments to God that took 10-20 years to build? The book explains that bit, with the importance of the Church in society and it's relation to the crown. 
 I am having trouble putting my finger on what I liked about the book. To friends who asked, I can't sell it every well. But it was a epic saga of love and power, and I loved every second. I think in the end, the lesson was that creating enemies leads you to get what you deserve. This might be a good summary of the book: 
 ""The duck swallows the worm, the fox kills the duck, the men shoot the fox, and the devil hunts the men."" 
 For the record, I hate William Hamleigh. I love Jack - he reminds me a bit of Howard Roark. And Aliena was inspirational. Philip was a prude but a good dude - I still can't believe he forgave Remigius. Interestingly, Waleran is once described as good person who just misunderstood his priorities - but I don't buy that.",13,5,1,264,69.46,37.87,20.79,73.53,16.5,18.18,85.98,63.26,53.79,13.26,8.33,4.92,0.0,1.52,1.14,0.0,4.92,18.18,11.74,1.52,10.98,7.58,3.03,7.2,1.52,12.88,3.79,4.92,5.3,1.52,0.76,3.41,9.47,0.76,8.71,2.65,1.14,1.52,0.76,0.0,3.03,0.38,8.33,5.68,2.27,3.79,3.03,0.38,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,12.88,5.68,0.76,0.0,1.52,0.76,0.76,7.58,0.0,0.76,0.0,2.27,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,4.92,0.0,0.0,2.27,0.76,1.89,1.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.38,1.89,3.79,4.17,0.38,0.38,3.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.89,4.92,3.79,0.38,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.18,5.68,5.3,0.38,0.0,1.89,4.92,0

"The Circle is a new bay area company, but is really Google+Facebook. It dominates search and social media, has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay, and is full of intelligent, ambitious young employees. This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us. It's essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness, and I think a serious 1984-esque warning about being too open. 
 I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic. The characters weren't very well developed. And I can't imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too - it was just too extreme to believe. But I suppose that was on purpose, as the author was just making a point. I appreciated the point (see below), but didn't love the story. 
 Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one. The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident - if your whole life is open to your friends and family, it's very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret. The premise of the Circle - that privacy and secrecy are bad - is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness. Or as its motto says: 
 All That Happens Must Be Known. 
 It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates. With public video cameras everywhere that document everything we do, and tons more data (photos, videos, texts) available to search engines to scan through. Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived. There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use. I heard of another startup that puts a video camera on you and it takes photos of everything all day and creates a montage of your day that is searchable/sortable for you. In many ways, we should already start acting like everything we do at least outside of our homes is being recorded on camera. 
 I think the central question the book poses is the one Bailey contemplates with Mae: is there such a thing as a good secret? Should we have privacy at all? Or would the world at large be better off if all secrets are known? I think we know where Mr Eggers stands on the subject, as the book seemed to be written in a dystopian, mocking kind of way. But it is in an interesting thought experiment, as many secrets would ultimately be better overall (not necessarily for the disclosing party, but for the overall situation), if they were known. For example you don't want to tell your friend that you know their significant other is cheating on them b/c you aren't supposed to know, but ultimately it would be better for them to know. Can you think of a secret you know that should be a secret? 
 But of course, there are lots of secrets that should stay secrets. Ignorance often truly is bliss, and people often just need to be weird and express themselves in ways that not everyone would appreciate if it were open. We are private beings, and yet our dignity and sense of self-worth largely stems from how others perceive us. I think this book is a thought-provoking story that shows us how our society is changing.",30,4,1,598,38.53,63.8,45.93,34.33,19.93,19.57,88.8,73.24,59.36,14.21,7.53,1.84,2.17,2.34,0.17,0.84,6.69,15.89,8.03,0.33,11.54,11.87,6.35,6.19,1.34,20.07,6.52,4.01,4.35,2.84,1.0,0.5,20.74,2.51,18.23,5.69,1.51,3.18,4.35,1.34,4.52,0.0,4.01,2.51,1.51,1.17,0.84,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.0,13.55,5.85,0.5,0.17,0.17,0.5,2.68,7.19,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.17,0.33,0.17,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.17,0.17,0.84,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.5,5.35,7.69,0.67,0.33,5.69,0.33,0.17,0.33,2.84,3.34,7.02,0.84,0.17,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.88,4.35,3.51,0.67,0.0,1.17,3.18,0
"I think there is one big idea to Slack that makes it worth reading for anyone dealing with leadership or leading at scale. A lot of the rest of the book is fairly obvious or not practical, so not giving it five stars. 
 The big idea of this book is that creativity can't be rushed, and if you don't build the slack into your schedule to spend some time creatively thinking about your business, you won't be able to innovate. You will only be able to be reactive, not proactive. The ""Hurry Up"" mindset is so easy to slip into - because there is always more to do than there is time. Providing a theory and data around the fact that having slack in your schedule is not only ok, but it's a good thing, is almost counter-intuitive, and thus really valuable to think about. 
 The book talks about how some companies slip into a ""hurry up"" mindset where everyone wants to look busy all the time. The danger of being busy is that you can too easily - especially if you are only being reactive - be busy on working on the wrong stuff. 
 ""Very successful companies have never struck me as particularly busy; in fact, they are, as a group, rather laid-back. Energy is evident in the workplace, but it's not the energy tinged with fear that comes from being slightly behind on everything."" 
 When managing people there is another kind of slack that the book points out: the slack to give up control to someone. Highly functioning people like to own their goals and process and have leeway to accomplish them on their own. As a manager, one of the hardest tasks is to balance giving them that autonomy with occasionally checking in or diving in to make sure things are on track. If you do it too much, you will annoy people or cause them to leave - if you do it too little your team could be wasting time heading in the wrong direction. 
 Other interesting points: 
 * In a hurry up organization, there is a natural tendency to try to get people to work harder/more to meet deadlines. While this can work over short stints, it's generally not sustainable. In fact, the book had a bunch of data to show that on average overtime hours aren't more productive. 
 * They analyzed the ""star performers"" in a number of companies, and the only thing they had in common they could point to was the strength of their networks. Establishing good connections and doing favors for others let's you get stuff done faster when you need to. 
 * The book makes a point that setting Quality goals for companies can be dangerous b/c you can so easily focus on the wrong metrics. For instance, reducing the number of bugs is correlated with quality, but it isn't the same thing as making a great product. This seems pretty obvious, so I'm not sure why it needed to be included in the book. 
 * It's important to set a vision for the organizations culture. The culture are those things that are so important to the organization that they should never change. If a organization lacks those, it will define itself as status quo and resist all change. 
 * Effective leaders build up trust, often before they've even earned it. The most effective way to do this is to acquire trust by giving trust. The act of giving trust is an enormously powerful gesture. The author told a story about a woman giving him her 2 year old daughter to carry off the plane. The trust she showed impressed him. 
 A great summary of the book:

"A fascinating in-depth and well researched look at the processed food industry. I recommend this for anyone who buys food at a grocery or convenience store (aka everyone). I read this book hoping to learn more about processed foods and how to avoid them, and I definitely got what I was looking for. Before reading this I was trying to avoid processed foods, and this book has helped increase that resolve, as well as educated me more on how to do it. It is absolutely amazing and frightening how many processed foods - some of which I remember fondly like Capri Sun - have enough salt/sugar/fat to easily account for a quarter or half of your daily recommended limit. This makes it super easy to go way over, and the result is unhealthy, fat Americans. 
 One of the more powerful things of this book was that Moss went deep into the food industry to really understand the dynamics at play. He didn't just demonize them for making the US one of the fattest countries in the world. He interviewed dozens of insiders - current and retired, to get their perspectives. 
 And the bottom line is scary. The food industry has zero incentive to produce healthier food. Because the high calorie food that they make that is stuffed with salt, sugar, and fat sells really well. It's tasty and convenient and cheap, and people buy whats tasty, and have no time or money to make or buy healthier options. And when the industry has tried to reduce the salt, sugar or fat, every time they find that it doesn't sell as well. Sure they have made some incremental improvements here and there, but by and large, the grocery store is a scary place if you don't want to vastly exceed your daily caloric intake. 
 It seems clear to me that things will never get better without government intervention - something that Moss also concludes in the book. Trying to understand a food label is impossible for most people, as (1) you have to know by heart the daily recommended values for calories, salt, sugar, and fat, and (2) you have to do math to figure out how many servings you are eating. Doing both of these just won't happen for 99% of the population, and thus we are where we are. We cannot rely on the food industry to make healthier products - we have make them do so by choosing with our wallets. 
 In my opinion, the FDA or someone in the government needs to get a good designer to fix food labels and get them to a state where any American can easily look at them and go ""oh my gosh this [can of pasta sauce] will account for [a quarter] of my daily recommended [caloric/protein/fat/sugar] intake if I eat it"". Maybe some startup can combine a phone camera and some image recognition to do this. The right organization to drive this is the FDA, but they are not acting. 
 So why doesn't the government act to prevent the obesity epidemic (and yes, that word is appropriate)? Moss spends a bit of time in the book examining this question, interviewing people at the FDA and the Dept of Agriculture. His conclusion is that they aren't incentivized or enabled to act. The food industry is well capitalized and has - for some inescapable reason to me - been able to fight every report of how bad their products are. Regulation is a tricky subject in America, but it seems that even the role of getting information to Americans about how to protect their health is completely broken. 
 One of the more interesting things I learned from the book is how sophisticated the food industry is in marketing their products. Their segmentation is impressive, and they find the right products, messages and mediums for each segment. They have learned to be on top of trends and perform slight of hand tricks with ease. For instance Americans initially loved their breakfasted cereals when marketed using the word ""sugar"". When people finally caught on that many of these were 50-70% sugar (!!!) the industry changed their marketing to promote other aspects, and removed the word sugar. Sugar Frosted Flakes became Frosted Flakes. Same thing for ""low salt"" or ""low fat"" or ""includes some vitamin or nutrient"" trends. 
 This is good to know if you are in the grocery store, as they still use these tricks. If a product is ""low sugar"", it's probably high in fat and/or salt, and same for ""low fat"" or ""low salt"". Or they will pick a nutrient or vitamin and promote that to hide the high amounts of salt, sugar & fat - for instance Tang was marketed as having lots of Vitamin-C (but was and is really bad for you). 
 One of the biggest trends that led to processed food in the past 40 years is summed up by the word ""convenience"". That's been a big part of the food industries marketing tactics, and it's worked. Life has become increasingly busy and complex, and we don't have time to go to work *and* shop for and cook a healthy meal. An aspect of this that I hadn't thought about is the rise of dual-working families - we have gone from 50% of women in the workforce in 1970 to 80% today. Families simply don't have time when both parents work to spend hours cooking when they get home. Thus, ""convenience"", or foods that are easy to buy and make, have risen drastically in that timeframe. 
 Emotionally, I could see how this marketing worked on me as a kid. Hearing about products that I used to eat and remembered fondly was kind of sad. Capri Sun, lunchables, hot pockets are just a few such examples mentioned in the book, none of which is particularly good for you. 
 The most damning evidence Moss finds is that none of the executives or insiders he talked to eat their own dogfood. In fact, they all have diets that explicitly prohibit it. I think that's very telling. 
 Overall, I think book will open your eyes to the ""battlefield"" for space and attention that goes on in the grocery store, and to pay more attention to the labels. That's a big educational process, but one which everyone needs to learn how to do. We need to force the food industry to stop producing foods that are unhealthy by stopping buying them.",28,5,1,1073,54.42,40.06,33.96,47.04,20.25,18.55,92.26,70.46,55.45,12.58,6.34,1.86,0.75,0.93,0.37,2.33,6.24,15.28,6.52,1.4,13.89,8.39,5.31,7.83,1.4,16.03,7.55,5.31,3.17,1.12,1.21,0.84,13.23,0.93,12.3,4.1,2.61,1.12,3.08,0.65,3.73,0.19,4.19,2.89,1.12,1.4,0.75,0.56,0.28,0.0,0.09,0.09,9.04,3.54,0.09,0.0,0.28,0.0,1.12,5.41,0.28,0.0,0.09,0.37,0.65,0.47,0.09,0.09,6.34,0.09,0.09,4.94,1.96,0.0,8.29,2.33,0.19,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.96,0.0,0.65,0.19,0.93,0.37,0.19,0.0,0.09,0.47,0.47,7.18,6.71,0.65,1.03,4.38,0.75,0.09,0.09,2.24,3.17,6.15,0.93,0.37,0.09,0.19,0.09,0.0,16.87,4.75,4.19,0.09,0.28,1.4,6.15,0
"My wife suggested I read this book, and I resisted for a while as my impression of it somehow was ""not for me"" - but I was wrong! I'm glad she finally convinced me, because it was fun and I couldn't put it down after I got ~20% in. 
 Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA, abandons her career as an architect to have kids, hates Seattle, and basically loses it over the course of the book. The book was fun and written a light, humorous tone - from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft, the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves (I loved how she called the other parents ""gnats""), to how she hires a virtual assistant in India. 
 But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is. You really do have to make life fun - it won't do it for you. 
 ""That's right,' she told the girls. 'You are bored. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it's boring now? Well, it only gets more boring.

"A wonderful, beautifully written, poignant, subtle, and brilliant novel. 
 This is the story of an English butler of one the great houses, whose self value comes from his duty and his dignity, and who questions his values and his life in the end. It is ultimately a story of regret. It is a story that makes you want to live your life and dedicate yourself to things that you won't regret when you look back. One of the best ways of thinking about regret I've ever come across is from Jeff Bezos in his nerdily titled Regret Minimization Framework. 
 But what I really loved about the novel is how slow and forcefully it builds. I don't think I've read a book that does that so well since Pride and Prejudice. In the beginning you think it's just a butler going on a motoring trip. And at the end, your heart is breaking. 
 Dignity is a big theme in the novel. Stevens attempts to define dignity several times throughout the novel - his definition generally has to do with self-respect and keeping ones emotions in check. But you have to wonder - his is suppression of emotions what leads him to where he ends up? His pushing himself to ""banter"" is a an interesting indication of him trying to break that pattern. 
 ""We may now understand better, too, why my father was so fond of the story of the butler who failed to panic on discovering a tiger under the dining table; it was because he knew instinctively that somewhere in this story lay the kernel of what true 'dignity' is."" 
 ""What do you think dignity's all about?' The directness of the inquiry did, I admit, take me rather by surprise. 'It's rather a hard thing to explain in a few words, sir,' I said. 'But I suspect it comes down to not removing one's clothing in public."" 
 In the end, Stevens breaks your heart in two ways: he missed out on the love of his life, AND he realizes that he dedicated his life to serving a man who in the end wasn't the great man he thought he was. Good reminder: prioritize love first. And work on things that matter. 
 Another aspect I loved is just learning about the era and how things in England worked. Fascinating for instance that multi-day stays at large estates were the only way to get a bunch of people together to communicate on an issue. Today, we communicate in very different ways. Seems appealing to try that way. 
 I'll conclude this with another of my favorite quotes from the novel: 
 You've got to enjoy yourself. The evening's the best part of the day. You've done your day's work. Now you can put your feet up and enjoy it. That's how I look at it. Ask anybody, they'll all tell you. The evening's the best part of the day.",44,5,1,483,59.92,87.52,37.44,80.33,15.09,16.15,91.51,72.26,58.8,18.84,11.8,2.69,0.41,3.52,4.14,0.21,7.04,17.81,9.11,0.83,14.91,7.45,5.8,4.35,0.83,15.94,4.76,3.93,4.35,1.24,2.69,0.83,13.25,1.04,12.22,4.97,1.86,1.66,1.86,0.21,2.07,0.21,6.63,4.97,1.04,3.31,1.66,1.04,0.21,0.0,0.83,0.0,18.22,6.63,0.62,0.21,0.0,1.24,3.11,10.97,0.21,0.0,0.0,5.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07,1.04,0.21,0.83,0.0,0.0,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.83,0.21,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.24,7.66,8.7,1.24,1.66,6.42,0.41,0.0,0.21,4.35,4.55,5.18,1.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.81,6.21,3.52,0.41,0.0,4.76,2.9,0
"A thought-provoking book about what makes people succeed. I thought it would be useful as a parent, but it wasn't really focused on children at all - it was more about our education system. 
 It was interesting to me that it could be proven that getting a GED had no positive correlation on future success. It was even more interesting that they could correlate adverse childhood experiences to negative adult outcomes. Stress, it turns out, is very harmful especially to younger people. Stress activates a physiological system in our bodies that evolved in order to deal with physical emergencies, but we turn it on for months and years on end, worrying about mortgages, relationships, and other such stuff that comes with a stressful life. It was interesting that the primary way to battle stress in young ones is having a good mother, who hugs/touches her kids a lot. 
 A lot of the rest of the book was examining various qualities of successful kids. It seems we are early in our understanding of this issue, but it was interesting learning about all the thinking and experiements that have been done. I think this quote sums up the best thesis of where we are: 
 ""The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure,"" Randolph told me.

"** spoiler alert ** 
 The conclusion to the epic of Hyperion, and a worthy one at that. I loved this series, and didn't expect I'd find the love story of Aenea and Raul so powerful. 
 In two words, this series was about evolution and love. 
 The Hyperion story is Yet Another Science Fiction Story About Artificial Intelligence (YASFSAAI) - but it's a damn good one, and more thought out and intricate than any I've ever seen. The Core is split into factions - the TODO - that fight and war amongst themselves, much as humans do. 
 The Core evolved from people. Core entities lacked empathy - or the ability to love - and were thus never able to evolve past being a parasite on humanity. The farcaster network was their first parasitic approach, the cruciforms were their second. 
 ""Thus evolved some members of the Core---not altruists, but desperate survivalists who realized that the only way ultimately to win their never-ending zero-sum game was to stop the game. And to stop the game they needed to evolve into a species capable of empathy."" 
 It's kind of sad that the Catholic Church is the evil character in the book. But is equally clear that after a great traumatic event like the Fall of the Farcasters, humanity turns to fear and uncertainty, and thus to religion. Unfortunately, the people in charge of that religion are the wrong sort, whose goal is power rather than the good of humanity. 
 The curiously named ""Void Which Binds"" is the true all-encompassing force in the universe. It is described in the following quotes: 
 ""Aenea heard the music of the spheres. She resonated with the Void Which Binds, which resonates in turn to sentient life and thought, and then she used the almost illimitable energy of the Void to ... to take the first step."" 
 ""That's what writers and artists and creators do, boy. Listen to the Void and try to hear dead folks' thoughts. Feel their pain. The pain of living folks too. Finding a muse is just an artist or holy man's way of getting a foot in the Void Which Binds' front door. Aenea knew that. You should have too."" 
 The one thing I never understood about this series is the Shrike. Why does he exist? In earlier books he's an evil entity. And now we learn something more about his relationship with Colonel Kassad, but not enough to explain his presence or why Aenea is able to rein him in - he almost becomes a good guy. 
 The thing I love most about this book, is that the true path, which Aenea is leading humanity on, can only be explained as a love story. Her and Raul's love is a worthy and necessary ending to The Cantos. 
 ""To see and feel one's beloved naked for the first time is one of life's pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition.""",2,5,1,535,77.62,48.95,22.84,36.21,16.21,18.13,87.29,66.17,55.14,10.28,4.67,0.93,0.19,0.19,1.68,1.12,5.61,19.44,11.21,1.68,13.08,7.66,5.05,6.92,0.93,13.08,6.73,4.3,4.86,1.68,1.68,1.68,14.58,2.06,12.52,3.36,0.75,1.68,2.43,0.0,4.11,0.0,7.66,4.11,2.99,4.11,2.24,1.5,0.19,0.0,0.37,0.19,13.27,5.79,0.75,0.0,0.19,1.12,1.31,7.29,0.37,0.0,0.56,1.68,0.56,0.0,0.19,0.37,3.36,0.75,0.37,0.93,0.0,1.31,2.43,1.12,0.93,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.37,0.75,0.0,0.37,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.93,0.37,5.42,8.41,0.37,1.12,5.23,0.37,0.75,0.93,2.62,3.74,5.23,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.44,6.36,5.05,0.19,0.0,2.43,5.42,0

"I really enjoyed this book. Some people told me that book 3 wasn't the match of books one and two, but I really quite enjoyed it. I'm struggling to put my finger on it, but I think the dynamic of Raul, Aenea, and A Bettik was a strong one - they clearly cared for each other, and you could see that they would even love each other in the future. 
 It had all the elements of a great epic: strong heroes on a mission that is important to humanity, an evil empire trying to stop them, and a mysterious force in the universe trying to help them. The world is almost 300 years after the fall of the farcasters, and is described in such a way as to almost be nostalgic. The hawking mat, all the characters and elements of Cantos, the consul's ship, etc. 
 One of the major themes of the book seems to be how the universe can be incredibly harsh. This quote captures it nicely: 
 ""The universe is indifferent to our fates. This was the crushing burden that the character took with him as he struggled through the surf toward survival or extinction. The universe just does not give a shit."" 
 And I just loved this one: 
 ""I remembered Grandam telling me about an early Old Earth scientist, one Charles Darwin, who had come up with one of the early theories of evolution or gravitation or somesuch, and how--although raised a devout Christian even before the reward of the cruciform--he had become an atheist while studying a terrestrial wasp that paralyzed some large species of spider, planted its embryo, and let the spider recover and go about its business until it was time for the hatched wasp larvae to burrow its way out of the living spider's abdomen."" 
 In harsh times, people often turn towards religion. Fascinating to see that after the Fall, after all the chaos and war and death that ensued, it was the Catholic church that rose to power, and goes onto to rule the universe. People are comforted by its ability to make the universe safe for them with the power of the cruciform. 
 One of the themes of the book is definitely fear. Fear of death in particular. De Soya fears each death he has, Raul came close to death on Mare Infinitus with the sharks. The Chitchatuk were interesting here - having to live a particularly fearful life, dependent on the thing that eats them for food (artic wraiths). 
 But love is the counter to the theme of fear. We keep getting hints that Aenea is the missionary from the human god and will show us all a better path through love.

"A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesn't let go. The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can't leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. 
 Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. 
 The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. 
 The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. 
 I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. 
 I liked Juliet too - she was the right combo of being determined to do right, and having brains and grit.",5,4,1,322,81.66,62.18,27.99,28.53,17.89,19.25,90.37,73.6,57.76,10.25,5.9,0.93,0.31,1.24,1.24,2.17,4.35,14.29,9.63,1.24,17.08,8.39,5.59,5.9,1.24,18.01,6.52,4.04,3.11,0.31,0.31,2.48,13.04,1.55,11.49,2.48,2.8,3.11,2.8,0.31,2.17,0.0,5.59,3.11,2.48,1.86,0.62,1.24,0.31,0.31,0.0,0.0,9.32,2.48,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.31,1.24,6.52,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.93,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.93,4.04,0.31,0.0,2.8,0.62,0.31,1.86,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,1.24,0.62,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.55,7.76,12.11,0.0,1.86,9.63,0.93,0.31,0.0,2.17,5.28,3.73,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.04,5.59,3.73,0.0,0.0,0.62,3.11,0
"A fascinating and heart-wrenching look inside a slum of Mumbai. A good reminder some of us have it much better than others - but also that human willpower still matters. 
 One of the most interesting things portrayed was just how different the rules are for the poor in India. When your family is one bad hospital bill away from being on the streets and starving, human life takes a different value. The story that stuck with me here is when one of the boys got hit by a car on his way to school, his mothers reaction was fury - because if it were any worse it would have bankrupted the family. This quote sums it up well: 
 ""It seemed to him that in Annawadi, fortunes derived not just from what people did, or how well they did it, but from the accidents and catastrophes they dodged. A decent life was the train that hadn't hit you, the slumlord you hadn't offended, the malaria you hadn't caught."" 
 Another way the rules are different is that the government is totally corrupt. Pretty hard to get ahead when everyone who can bribe you has got their hand out. 
 ""The Indian criminal justice system was a market like garbage, Abdul now understood. Innocence and guilt could be bought and sold like a kilo of polyurethane bags."" 
 But my favorite part of the book was seeing how entrepreneurial people had to be in order to survive. Whether its sorting garbage, being a garbage middleman, or any of the other pursuits various people did to make money, it seemed that at least in one respect the rules of the slum are the same as everywhere else: you've got to work hard and be good at what you do to get ahead. It's just that in the slum, it's so easy to lose it all. Poverty begets poverty, wealth begets wealth.",7,4,1,313,48.87,41.95,28.66,20.23,20.87,15.97,89.46,72.52,61.34,13.42,5.43,0.64,0.32,2.24,0.96,0.96,7.99,17.89,9.27,1.28,13.42,11.18,7.03,6.71,1.28,16.29,7.67,4.15,6.39,0.32,2.24,3.83,13.74,0.96,12.78,1.92,1.92,0.96,2.56,0.32,7.03,0.32,7.03,3.51,3.51,1.92,0.64,1.28,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.0,10.22,2.88,0.32,0.0,0.32,1.6,0.32,6.71,0.32,0.0,0.32,1.28,1.6,0.96,0.32,0.32,4.47,0.0,0.0,1.6,3.19,0.0,1.28,0.64,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.96,0.0,1.92,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.32,0.64,7.67,7.67,0.64,0.32,5.75,0.64,0.0,0.64,1.28,7.03,4.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.74,4.79,4.15,0.0,0.0,1.92,2.88,0
"A truly inspirational book by a truly inspirational man. Coach Wooden coached 17 seasons at Indiana and UCLA before winning a championship - and then he won 10 out of the next 12! He is one of the greatest coaches ever, and Reading his book gives some great insights into his philosophy. 
 My only criticism of the book is that I think he spent too much time comparing his players, and answering questions like ""who was your greatest player"". I guess he got those questions a lot, but it didn't add much for me. 
 One of his top values was conditioning. He thought games were often or largely out of his control as a coach, but what was in his control was how conditioned his team was, and he made a point to have the best conditioned team out there. In fact, he often refused to call timeouts in key situations, banking on his teams conditioning down the stretch. As he said, ""ninety percent of the time the game will be decided in the last 5 minutes"", and of course the better conditioned team will make less mistakes in that time. 
 If any one premise typifies my teams in all the years I've coached, it is this concept. Often as a player, I'd tell myself, ""I may play someone better than I am, but I'll never run against one who is going to be in better condition"" And I never played against a man in my life I felt was in better shape, and Lambert often cited me as an example of top conditioning."" 
 Another key aspect of Wooden's philosophy was that he believed the little things, the details, really mattered. Two examples of this: First one was that one of the first things he taught new players was how to properly put their socks and shoes on. It turns out, you can easily do it wrong, which leads to blisters - but kind of amazing to think of him teaching Kareem or Bill Walton how to put their socks on! The second was he really believed in strict discipline and cleanliness - for instance he believed in the team cleaning up a locker room before leaving. These little details would ""establish a spirit of togetherness and consideration that help unite the team into a solid unit."" 
 Wooden believed in focus, and ""playing your game"": 
 ""In game play it was always my philosophy that patience would win out. By that, I meant patience to follow our game plan. If we believed in it, we would wear the opposition down and would eventually get to them. If we broke away from our style, however, and played their style, we would be in trouble. And if we let our emotions, rather than our reason, command the game we would not function effectively."" 
 Interestingly, Wooden didn't believe in ""charging teams up on an emotional level"", as many coaches do. In fact, I bet most people that that giving inspirational, charged up speeches is one of the key attributes of a great coach. So this was interesting - and helpful in a lot of ways - people respond more to confidence and having a plan. 
 One tactically smart thing Wooden did right before he started winning championships, was to change his practices from having 5 starters vs 5 second team, to 7 or 8 first teamers vs the rest. The first team during practice was literally a rotation between those 7 or 8. This got the key bench players used to playing with the first team, and made a world of a difference. 
 But I think my favorite takeaway from the book, was Wooden's philosophy on what to ask of his players. He didn't ask them to win. He asked them to strive to have a ""perfect practice"", or a ""perfect game"". In other words, to play to the very best they can in the given moment. While that may sound obvious, keeping his teams focused on that instead of winning likely made the difference. It's all too easy to start focusing on winning or losing or things that aren't in the moment. 
 ""When I was teaching basketball, I urged my players to try their hardest to improve on that very day, to make that practice a masterpiece. 
 Too often we get distracted by what is outside our control. You can't do anything about yesterday. The door to the past has been shut and the key thrown away. You can do nothing about tomorrow. It is yet to come. However, tomorrow is in large part determined by what you do today. So make today a masterpiece. You have control over that. 
 This rule is even more important in life than basketball. You have to apply yourself each day to become a little better. By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better. Only then will you will be able to approach being the best you can be. It begins by trying to make each day count and knowing you can never make up for a lost day.""

"A hilarious romp through the known and unknown universe that exposes how ridiculous much of US copyright law is. Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. 
 The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. 
 It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate.

"This book has a great premise, and is full of some beautifully written prose. It's about a hacker during the Arab Spring, helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population. Alif falls in love, finds an ancient book, gets into trouble with State, enlists the help of an unseen, magical world full of creatures call Jinn, and combats evil. The story flowed well, and was a fast, fun read. 
 I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm a computer programmer, and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of made-up visuals that have nothing to do with hacking. The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didn't know what to make of it. For instance, when Alif is hacking into State's intranet, it is described as: 
 ""The Hand roused. It lumbered to its feet, reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones, revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected. He reeled backward, recalibrating. Breaching the confines of the State intranet, the Hand began to attack the base of Alif's tower, slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before."" 
 I didn't know a computer program could ""reek of ionized air"" - and can't conceive of how a mirroring protocol (if there is such a thing) could ever be used to ""slice away layers of code"". 
 I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense. But it just didn't. And that was the heart of the story - that the ancient text contained an all-powerful computer algorithm. I also had trouble buying the Alif & Dina relationship - the characters just felt shallow to me.",7,3,1,310,81.29,14.06,38.08,33.77,20.67,20.32,82.26,64.84,52.9,8.71,3.23,2.26,0.0,0.32,0.32,0.32,5.48,15.81,11.61,0.32,14.84,8.39,6.45,5.48,2.26,14.52,4.52,2.58,1.61,0.97,0.0,0.65,10.0,0.97,9.03,2.9,1.94,1.61,0.32,0.0,2.58,0.0,4.19,2.58,1.61,0.65,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.81,4.52,0.65,0.0,0.32,0.32,2.9,1.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,2.9,0.32,0.32,2.26,4.84,0.65,0.0,3.87,0.32,0.0,1.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.97,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.65,0.32,4.52,10.32,0.65,0.97,6.13,1.29,0.0,1.61,3.55,8.06,3.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.06,4.84,5.81,0.0,0.0,2.58,4.84,0
"A fun, dark, slightly comical western about two killers (Charlie and Eli Sisters) on their way to California for the gold rush. Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience - I'm not sure I totally enjoyed it. But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing; it was clean, fun, and even poetic - which made this book a quick enjoyable read. 
 I loved all the introspective one-liners that Eli kept throwing out. For instance: 
 ""but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious."" 
 ""I thought, When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himself--there is a physical, impenetrable separation between him and his fellows."" 
 Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for."" 
 ""It is true, I thought. I am living a life."" 
 ""The effects of her words stung me, and after she stole away I stood a long while before her looking glass, studying my profile, the line I cut in this world of men and ladies."" 
 I struggled however to find the point of this novel. What lesson was I meant to take away? What did we learn from Charlie and Eli's adventure? I suppose if anything the theme of the book was transformation. We witnessed Warm, Morris, and Eli have the courage to transform themselves and change their lives. In other words - it's easy to let life dictate your path. Eli's story of how Charlie sucked him into a life of crime was fascinating. Warm had a similar story of how he became a thief. We didn't learn about Morris's past, but we did see the difficulty of his decision to leave the Commodore's employment. It takes guts to transform oneself - especially for the better.",2,3,1,316,51.28,26.34,78.51,33.49,15.8,20.57,88.92,70.57,55.7,17.09,11.71,5.7,1.27,0.32,3.48,0.95,5.38,14.56,8.86,0.32,12.66,7.59,5.06,6.96,0.95,16.14,6.96,1.58,3.8,1.9,0.63,1.58,14.24,0.32,13.92,3.8,1.9,0.32,1.58,0.63,5.06,0.0,6.65,3.8,2.85,2.53,1.9,0.63,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.0,12.97,5.06,0.0,0.32,0.95,0.63,2.22,7.59,0.32,0.0,1.58,2.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.43,1.9,0.63,1.58,0.32,0.0,3.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.63,0.63,0.63,0.0,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.58,6.33,10.76,0.32,1.27,6.65,1.27,0.0,0.95,3.8,8.86,3.8,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.3,5.7,4.43,0.63,0.0,2.22,6.33,0
"A fascinating story of world war one. I knew the basics, but it was fascinating to hear the story told through some of the characters involved, and see how it all played out. 
 On the surface, WW1 was started pretty stupidly. The arch-duke of Austria was assassinated, so in retaliation Austria invaded Serbia. Serbia had an alliance with Russia so they stepped in, and then Germany had an alliance with Austria, so suddenly Germany and Russia were at war. Russia and France had a treaty and since they surrounded Germany, the Germans went on the offensive in France, which dragged in Britain. And then the US got dragged in later by Britain and b/c Germans were sinking our ships. 
 But there was more to the story. These countries didn't have to honor these treaties - they could have found a way to not commit to a war. It's almost like they were all war hungry. Follett also tried, through some of the female characters like Maud, to indicate that if the world had been controlled by women then war would never have happened (probably true). This was a great quote: 
 ""In every country, those who were against war had been overruled. The Austrians had attacked Serbia when they might have held back; the Russians had mobilized instead of negotiating; the Germans had refused to attend an international conference to settle the issue; the French had been offered the chance to remain neutral and had spurned it; and now the British were about to join in when they might easily have remained on the sidelines."" 
 One issue of the war I hadn't considered was the financial pressures it brought to bear once a country had committed. This was brought up artfully by Ethel's husband Bernie. Once Germany, Britain, etc had declared and spent a ton of money building their army and fighting the war, they were stuck. The people in power - the aristocracy - needed to win or they would go bankrupt and risk losing power. They were pot-committed, and too proud to turn back. 
 ""And what if Britain lost? There would be a financial crisis, unemployment, and destitution. Working-class men would take up Ethel's father's cry and say that they had never been allowed to vote for the war. The people's rage against their rulers would be boundless."" 
 My one criticism of the book was that the character Fitz was made out to be a real simpleton. Ethel and Billy seemed to intellectually walk all over him and he never defended himself (or it was left out) - didn't seem terribly realistic. 
 I think my favorite part was learning about the Bolshevik revolution - that was a piece of history I really didn't know enough about, and it was described in great detail through Grigory and his story. Czar Nicholas II fell from power during the war, and the Bolsheviks staged a revolution and took over. But its hard to control a country! 
 ""A baby was like a revolution, Grigori thought: you could start one, but you could not control how it would turn out."" 
 The class struggles in England, Germany and Russia were clearly a major theme to the book. In each country Follett was careful to show how the aristocracy were fools and didn't know what they were doing. It really highlighted why a democracy is a better way of doing things!",6,4,1,561,58.5,39.02,44.02,3.41,18.1,21.57,88.24,69.88,57.75,8.91,4.81,1.07,0.18,0.36,0.71,2.32,4.1,15.15,9.63,1.25,12.83,12.48,5.53,7.49,1.78,20.5,4.46,3.03,8.73,1.07,1.25,6.42,12.83,1.25,11.41,2.5,1.78,1.78,2.14,0.71,3.57,0.0,6.95,2.32,4.63,0.89,0.18,0.71,0.0,0.36,0.18,0.0,11.23,4.99,0.53,0.0,1.25,0.36,1.78,5.7,0.53,0.0,0.36,1.43,3.74,2.67,1.07,0.0,1.96,0.18,0.0,1.25,0.71,0.0,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.18,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.89,0.18,0.0,0.18,0.71,0.71,6.06,10.34,0.53,2.14,7.31,0.36,0.18,0.18,3.21,13.01,0.53,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.69,4.99,3.92,0.18,0.36,1.78,4.46,0
"This book takes us into the crazy world of North Korea. Imagine a world where the government controls all information and creates a ton of propaganda. There are loudspeakers in every home that tell this propaganda every morning and every evening. Everyone believes their leader is a saint, that the rest of world (especially Americans) are out to get them and could sneak attack at any moment, that South Korea and America are more poor than they are and thus the Dear Leader is sending them food for aid, and on and on. 
 The books tells the story of Jun Do, who grows up in an orphanage as the son of the Oprhan Master, and while he claims he's technically not an orphan, it's clear that in effect he is. Orphans are portrayed as lost souls, the bottom of the ladder in society, and always on the search for a father-figure. The first half of the book tells a fairly normal story of Jun Do doing work for his country. 
 Jun Do had training to withstand pain, ostensibly in case the South Koreans or Japanese captured him. I found the tidbits mentioned around this very interesting - though not sure how accurate they are. One was to establish a place in your mind with lots of light, and don't leave it, no matter how much pain. The other, which I think sounds useful in general, is more for prisoners or any cooped up, and is summed up in this quote: 
 ""Use your imagination only on the future, never on the present or the past."" 
 The second half of the book was completely different from the rest of the story, and it was so out of left field and odd that I didn't enjoy it as much. Jun Do assumes the identity of Commander Ga and gets the most beautiful woman in North Korea to accept him? Really? I didn't really like the story being told from the interrogators point of view either. But I did like learning more about Sun Moon - especially her relationship with the Dear Leader. 
 Another criticism is that a lot of the dialogue read like it was people in America chatting. A Korean friend also noticed this - it didn't feel very Korean in many places - and thus didn't feel very authentic. 
 But what I loved most about the book was just the glimpse into North Korea. It's amazing how complete a people can be controlled if you can control their information inputs. I loved the part when they visit America and the Americans keep whispering ""You know you lost the war, right?"" - because they knew the North Korean government tells it's citizens they won. 
 I wonder if the internet has changed things? There are a few members of Goodreads who put North Korea as their country - but we have zero traffic from that country, so perhaps they are all expats/escapees. 
 I'll leave you with my favorite line from the book:

"I loved this book. Although it was a beast of a book, and could probably have been a lot shorter. I had not read a Lincoln biography before, so was firstly blown away by how he rose up from nothing, self-taught himself a college degree, and then somehow rode the middle line and got himself elected President. Nobody seemed to have expected that, nor expected much from him, and he continued to surprise them all. 
 I am always curious about the motivations of successful people. In Lincolns case, he just literally seemed to want to have the respect of his peers, and of the American people. ""Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition,"" he wrote. ""I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem."" 
 Lincoln's tactic to make his enemies his cabinet was also interesting and ultimately brilliant. Especially because he was so unknown, but also because they were the strongest options, and would be hard for him to manage. The confidence he had was impressive. Lincoln constantly showed this higher level of trust in people that many wouldn't have given because it didn't make themselves look good. Hiring people who are smarter than you, and giving them credit when things go right, is very hard to do. 
 But Lincoln could afford to trust his people and even hire people like Chase, who was on his staff yet coveted his job, because he was a masterful tactician. He seemed to have a knack for how to position things to the public at the right times to achieve the right outcomes. The main example of this is of course holding back the proclamation of emancipation so the border states didn't slip into the war on the side of south - but there were many more examples. 
 One thing that surprised me was how lax access to the white house and president were back then. You could literally just walk into the White House and get in line to see the President. And he seemed to only have one security guard - who happened to be ""off-duty"" the night he was killed. 
 I think Lincolns main strength was his empathy. He spent a lot of time trying to understand the people of different states, and putting himself in their shoes and imagining how they felt given what they knew about the situation. A tough, tough thing to do as his whole presidency was during a civil war during which over 600,000 soldiers died. I can't imagine having that on your conscience and trying to internalize that. But a very valuable skill to have as a leader. 
 ""Lincoln had internalized the pain of those around him--the wounded soldiers, the captured prisoners, the defeated Southerners. Little wonder that he was overwhelmed at times by a profound sadness that even his own resilient temperament could not dispel.""",19,5,1,487,40.56,63.16,4.96,48.37,18.73,19.92,92.61,74.33,60.57,14.78,10.47,1.85,0.0,0.62,5.75,1.64,4.31,15.61,7.6,0.82,13.96,9.86,6.57,8.01,2.05,17.25,7.39,3.49,6.78,0.82,1.85,4.11,13.96,1.23,12.73,3.29,2.46,2.26,2.05,0.62,3.29,0.0,5.75,3.49,1.64,1.85,0.62,0.62,0.21,0.0,0.21,0.0,12.94,2.67,0.41,0.0,0.41,0.41,0.62,10.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.16,1.64,1.44,0.21,0.0,3.08,0.0,0.41,2.26,0.41,0.0,1.23,0.82,0.41,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.41,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.41,1.44,6.78,7.8,0.62,1.23,4.52,1.03,0.0,0.82,2.87,7.8,1.23,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.55,5.34,4.31,0.0,0.0,1.03,2.87,0
"This is a fascinating glimpse into American history, of which I was largely ignorant - well worth a read. I had no idea prohibition lasted 14 years! My only criticism is the author spent way too much time on the politics of prohibition - that could have been cut by half. 
 The bottom line of prohibition is that is was a massive failure. It singlehandedly created organized crime, cost the government lots of money in lost taxes and enforcement, and failed to stop pretty much anyone from drinking. 
 It did have some upside though. Americans had a drinking problem and definitely drank less overall during prohibition, and even afterwards. But more importantly prohibition helped transform American culture. Prohibition coincided with massive immigration and population growth, which all happened in the cities. It was really a battle between urban culture and rural culture. It particularly didn't make sense in urban culture, and people rebelled, giving us ""the roaring 20's"". Prohibition helped us go from a stay at home culture to one where it was acceptable to go out and consume liquor. 
 Prohibition gave us income tax. The Anti-Saloon League (ASL), which was the organization that pushed prohibition through, pushed income tax through first because the government couldn't approve prohibition without finding an alternate source of revenue for the massive amount of tax money (30% of federal revenue) it made on liquor. 
 Many businesses got their starts in prohibition. Walgreens went from 20 to 525 stores during prohibition, because of the legal loophole that medicinal liquor was allowed, so drugstores were a major source of liquor sales. Coca Cola saw sales triple. The entire ecosystem of Nassau and the Bahamas was created. Sam Bronfman, the largest bootlegger in Canada, turned his operation into a legitimate business afterwards, owning many major liquor brands under the Seagrams brand. 
 The major failing of prohibition, and the reason it was eventually repealed, was the organized crime. Al Capone was the poster boy, but all the major mafia families got their start bootlegging, then got organized, then went on to bigger and better criminal activities. Yes it gave us Las Vegas, but it wasn't a good thing. If anything, this is the argument for the legalization of Marijuana (though there are other factors there). 
 In the end I think that prohibition was a bad idea because it was the government trying to tell Americans how to live. Individuals have to take responsibility for themselves.",8,3,1,405,76.2,34.44,42.21,7.1,16.2,26.67,90.12,66.67,49.63,8.64,2.96,0.99,0.99,0.0,0.25,0.74,5.68,14.81,8.64,1.73,11.85,7.16,5.19,5.68,0.99,16.54,8.64,6.91,9.38,1.98,1.73,5.68,11.85,0.74,11.11,2.47,2.72,0.74,1.73,0.49,3.21,0.0,3.95,1.23,2.72,0.74,0.25,0.49,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,7.41,2.72,0.49,0.0,0.74,0.49,0.49,3.21,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.49,1.98,1.48,0.49,0.0,5.68,0.0,0.25,2.47,3.95,0.0,3.46,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.48,0.0,2.47,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74,4.94,8.4,0.25,1.73,6.17,0.25,0.25,0.25,3.46,9.63,1.73,0.74,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,15.31,5.93,5.19,0.0,0.25,0.99,2.96,0
"Wow. Amazing story, and well told - kept me up late at night! Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. 
 One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. 
 I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. 
 One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.",50,5,1,261,36.61,44.6,28.21,74.09,20.08,14.94,87.74,70.88,57.09,12.26,7.66,3.45,0.77,0.77,0.0,2.68,4.6,14.18,4.6,2.3,14.18,8.05,9.58,8.81,1.15,17.24,7.28,5.36,3.83,0.77,0.77,2.3,12.26,0.77,11.49,3.83,3.07,0.77,2.3,1.53,1.92,0.0,7.28,4.98,1.53,1.92,1.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,12.64,5.75,0.0,0.0,0.77,1.15,2.3,6.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.77,0.0,0.0,2.3,1.15,0.0,0.38,0.38,0.38,2.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.15,0.77,1.15,0.0,1.53,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,7.28,6.13,0.38,1.15,4.21,0.77,0.0,0.0,1.15,7.66,3.45,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,15.71,4.6,4.6,0.0,0.38,3.45,2.68,0

"This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. 
 The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful. He believed that computers were ""at the intersection of technology and liberal arts"" - a phrase he used a lot - because he realized computers weren't just for geeks. They are for everyone, and needed to be able to be used by everyone. 
 Steve put design at the top of product pyramid at Apple - above engineering. This means they spent a lot of time trying to fit the hardware into the beautifully designed cases the designers came up with, and the designers and engineers had to work together closely. This can backfire (eg Antennagate), but largely it worked really well. It produced amazing computers that were visually distinct from everything else in the market, and that ""just work"". If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it. 
 Apple's design philosophy is to ""make it simple. Really simple"". You still see this today - go to Apple.com - you will see ONE product. Now try Amazon. According to the book, Jobs learned this from Markkula, who taught him that ""A great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it makes"". 
 Steve's ethos was basically that if you are going to do something, do it right. The book is full of examples of Steve doing this. When the iMac first came out it looked like no other computer. It was interesting to hear how difficult it was for the engineers to accommodate a handle on the computer - but it ended up being a defining feature of the computer. I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores. 
 Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like ""jerk"" to describe him. It sounds like Steve could definitely be a jerk to work for. His management style was to push people as hard as he could, and to let people know when they didn't perform. When pushed like that, a person can have one of two reactions: they either resent it, and end up quitting or getting fired (B-players) - or they accept the challenge to do better, and come back the next week with something even better. Win-win for Steve - he filters out the b-players and gets his a-players to produce the best work they can. 
 But, as was pointed out in the book, if Steve was nothing but a jerk, he wouldn't have built a company full of loyal employees - Apple has one of the lowest turnover rates in the valley. Jobs only hired people who ""had a passion for the product"". I also liked how he motivated by looking at the bigger picture; such as the story of how he convinced his engineer that saving 10 seconds off the boot time was worth it because across 5 million users that would save 100 lifetimes per year. 
 The book was full of references to Steve's dynamic personality; his ""reality distortion field"" is a great descriptor. Steve believed he could do anything - and he was so persuasive that he could convince those around him that they could whatever it was too. I think this is one of the most defining qualities of an entrepreneur - believing something can be done against all odds. Not being afraid to tear down walls or think outside the box. 
 I loved the description of Steve that ""whatever he was touting was the best thing he ever produced."" You see him do this in his keynote speeches too. He is always using words like ""best"", ""amazing"", etc to describe whatever he's launching. 
 A big theme that the author made was that especially early on, Steve viewed Apple as ""counter-culture"" rebels. They were hippies who thought they could change the world. And they did - but not only that - I think they embedded their can-do attitude deep in Silicon Valley, which is probably highly correlated with why it is the center of the technology revolution today. This quote is classic: 
 ""The people who invited the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently. The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence."" 
 One of Steve's great abilities was to focus. When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential. 
 ""What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they're dragging you down. They're turning you into Microsoft. They're causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great."" 
 Steve's belief that computers need to be beautiful and easy to use basically prevented him from ever licensing his software, as then he wouldn't be able to control the user experience. Microsoft didn't have that problem, and that's why Windows dominated. I think it's also the reason that Windows is in trouble today. They have spent a decade making their code work across hundreds of different hardware configurations. Their code is now full of backwards compatibility support that just makes it messy, and bloated. Worse, their focus is on maintaining all that instead of innovating and improving it. 
 The platform vs integrated approach is being tested again with the iphone vs android. It will be interesting to see if history replays itself, or if Apple's lead and ability to make a superior product because of their full stack control will prevail.

"A hilarious and book from Tina Fey - definitely worth listening to over audio as she reads it herself. She makes fun of herself a lot, adds lots of light humor, and of course shares TMI. 
 The most interesting bit was hearing the behind the scenes of Saturday Night Live, and how she was a joke writer there for 3 years before they gave her a role on the show, which was only doing the news. Her breakout occurred after she had already left for 30 Rock, when she did the Sarah Palin impersonation.

"** spoiler alert ** 
 Loved it. The epic saga continues. The poor Starks are torn apart, but yet are surprisingly resilient. In fact, pretty much every major character is in danger of dying and some even do. It's a bit tough to read, as you really wanted The King In The North to succeed. And Dany is fast becoming an interesting part of the plot that has yet to intermix with the rest of the characters.

"I first read this ~10 years ago and just re-read it as someone reminded me that it predicts the future of reading. And it does - what I love about Stephenson is his high level of prescient-ness. In fact I think it also predicts a lot of the future of nanotechnology and entertainment. 
 The Young Ladies Illustrated Primer is a dynamic book with an AI in it. Imagine Alexa or Siri in 5-10 years, smart enough to make up stories on the fly and answer questions about or even redirect the storyline. The YLIP is designed in the book for a 4 year old girl, Fiona, but Nell and a few other girls end up with them also. Maybe this resonated with me as I have a 4 year old girl and wish this existed for her. What's particularly powerful about this, is the story was able to be adaptive to the problems in Nell's life, and give her strength and confidence at moments when she needed it. Some cool trivia: Project Fiona was the codename for the Kindle. There is now a building at Amazon in Seattle named Fiona. 
 One of the pieces of magic of the Young Ladies Illustrated Primer was that for Nell and Fiona's editions, there were live actors (""ractors"") on the other end, reading all the lines 1 on 1. This put a level of personalization and human connection into the story for the girls that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. Learning about the marketplace of ractors was particularly interesting and it's hard to think such a thing won't exist in 2-5 years as VR takes off. Would you rather watch the movie Harry Potter or live act out the scenes with 2 friends as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and have professional actors play the other characters? You can imagine this being a big form of entertainment of the future. 
 The nanotechnology described in the book was also fascinating. Describing a world of robots and drones too small for the human eye to see, doing tasks and even fighting each other. Massive wars we perceive as ""particularly dusty days"". Poisoning or taking control of another person is as easy as getting them to inhale or injest some nanobots. The drummers were a particularly interesting notion of hive-mind, connecting multiple humans together through nanobots attached to their synapses on their brain. And then of course you have nanobots creating other bots, which led to this great quote: 
 ""The Victorian system used Darwinian techniques to create killers adapted to their prey, which was elegant and effective but led to the creation of killers that were simply too bizarre to have been thought up by humans, just as humans designing a world never would have thought up the naked mole rat."" 
 But of course the biggest implication of nanotechnology is the ability to manipulate molecules and thus - given The Feed (which I somehow provides a stream of molecules & energy for manipulation) - you can make anything in a Matter Compiler (MC). This is kind of like what they had in Star Trek, and what 3D printing gives us .0001% of today. 
 The book is largely about what would happen to society if MC's were invented and much of the need for farming, manufacturing, etc was eliminated. Poverty would become even more prevalent, as would crime, governments would collapse, and of course, a class divide would emerge as never before, driven by those who have technology and those who don't. And of course, badass engineers like Hackworth will rule the day (kind of). I suppose in a way the book is about the fear of what will happen if technology progresses too far and leaves masses of humans without a purpose in life. Parking lots and chaos. 
 ""These were rice paddies before they were parking lots. Rice was the basis for our society. Peasants planted the seeds and had highest status in the Confucian hierarchy. As the Master said, ""Let the producers be many and the consumers few.' When the Feed came in from Atlantis, from Nippon, we no longer had to plant, because the rice now came from the matter compiler. It was the destruction of our society. When our society was based upon planting, it could truly be said, as the Master did, ""Virtue is the root; wealth is the result.' But under the Western ti, wealth comes not from virtue but from cleverness. So the filial relationships became deranged. Chaos,"" Dr. X said regretfully, then looked up from his tea and nodded out the window. ""Parking lots and chaos.""",31,5,1,761,75.74,54.94,17.68,35.09,19.51,18.92,85.94,65.83,55.58,9.07,4.2,1.05,0.79,0.53,0.66,0.92,4.86,15.77,9.33,1.58,15.64,8.41,5.26,8.67,0.92,14.19,5.52,4.07,4.73,1.18,1.05,2.5,13.14,0.53,12.61,1.58,1.84,1.97,2.63,1.31,3.15,0.13,3.55,2.23,1.18,0.79,0.53,0.26,0.13,0.0,0.13,0.13,9.72,3.02,0.0,0.26,0.39,0.26,1.18,6.44,0.0,0.13,1.18,0.26,1.71,0.13,0.0,1.58,3.29,0.92,0.13,1.71,0.66,0.0,1.97,0.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.26,0.53,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.58,4.2,7.23,0.53,0.79,5.39,0.66,0.0,0.26,3.68,4.86,3.29,1.18,0.13,0.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.64,5.26,4.47,0.13,0.0,1.31,4.47,0
"Great story of the US Ambassador to Germany and his experience during the build-up of ww2 from 1933 - 1937. Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. 
 Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. 
 I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. 
 I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.",5,4,1,295,72.14,30.62,46.42,40.05,24.58,16.27,90.85,76.95,60.34,10.17,6.78,2.37,0.0,0.0,2.71,1.69,3.39,17.29,9.49,3.39,14.92,7.12,6.44,7.8,1.69,16.95,8.14,6.44,2.03,0.34,0.0,1.69,14.92,1.36,13.56,4.41,1.36,1.36,3.73,1.69,3.39,0.0,5.42,3.39,2.03,2.71,1.36,1.36,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.47,2.71,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.34,1.69,5.76,0.34,0.0,0.34,2.71,1.69,1.69,0.0,0.0,2.71,0.34,0.0,2.03,0.68,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.34,1.02,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.68,4.41,8.47,0.34,1.69,6.44,0.68,0.34,0.34,3.39,8.47,2.03,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.56,4.07,5.08,0.0,0.0,1.02,3.39,0

"Super fun book - the story of a sysadmin chasing a hacker during the early internet, but it reads almost like a thriller - fun and fast. 
 I think I learned more about the early internet from this book than anything I've ever read before. I had heard of the words Arpanet and Milnet, but really didn't know what they were - simple networks of computers. And apparently, with very poor security!

"Great story about the founding of Microsoft from it's cofounder Paul Allen. I've read a few books about Microsofts history before (such as Gates), but it was fascinating to hear it from the horses mouth. 
 What stuck out for me was that Paul and Bill were on the cutting edge of software ever since they first saw a computer as teenagers. Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers mentioned the fact that having access to a computer at that time was a huge advantage, and Paul's story confirms that. The world only changes massively so many times, and the age of computing has certainly been one of them - and Paul and Bill were in the right place, at the right time, and with the right drive to succeed. 
 What was impressive was how Paul and Bill executed like crazy. They had the edge, and they worked really hard, long hours to keep it. It was sad that Paul burned out so early - but also understandable given that Bill had such a strong personality. 
 Paul prides himself on being a forward thinker. He gives multiple stories of always following the latest technology and trying to look forward and think about what is coming next. Indeed, it's that trait that led to Microsoft being formed as they were certainly at the forefront of the software revolution. In one part of the book Paul even predicts that Mobile is the next big platform and that the PC is dying. 
 I've always worked at startups, which tend to innovate more than they follow. So it was interesting to hear Allen talking about how Microsoft's strategy went from being on the cutting edge of technology in it's infancy to being a 400 pound gorilla that used a approach of copying innovative products and using it's cash reserves and muscle to out-execute on an idea. I suppose this is what a big company has to do - but it's a hard position to win from. An Microsoft really hasn't had a lot of wins lately. They haven't innovated enough on Hotmail. Bing is nice but not better than Google in any significant ways. And even the high and mighty Internet Explorer is really losing ground to Chrome/Firefox/Safari. Paul is right - you have to look to what is ahead. 
 Since Microsoft, Paul has certainly stayed busy: owning sports teams, investing in lots of different companies, building a space program, and touring around on his 400 foot yacht. Most of his investments have been in the vein of improving technology and trying to predict the next big things, especially in his particular interests. 
 I think his brain mapping project and the Digital Aristotle projects stand out - they sound really interesting and important. The appendix lists a few of the current challenges issues with getting a computer to understand human language, which was fascinating. Allen even alludes to the oft-mentioned Singularity, but says that he doesn't think it will occur in our lifetimes, as despite Moore's law advancing computing power fast enough, we are lightyears away with AI. 
 Some useful tidbits: 
 - p65 Even Bill Gates wasn't the best at Math in college at Harvard. There are all kinds of smarts! 
 - Lesson: decentralize or don't distract the ceo: http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/... 
 - It was interesting that Allen said that his biggest mistakes were not finding the right people to help him execute his visions. It's all about people.

"** spoiler alert ** 
 A very well written series of short stories. There was no ""main"" character, though I was curious and counted and out of 13 chapters, Sasha was in 5 and and Bennie Salazar was in 4. The story wove and dipped in and out of their lives, and occasionally into surrounding characters. I thought it was a little hard to keep track of all the stories and how they related, though. 
 I think Lou was one of my favorite characters. Lou is a stereotypical record producer and ladies man. I loved how he at one point was quoted as saying ""I'll never get old"", and then there was a whole chapter later dedicated to his death. Lou is one of those guys that is immediately likable, even though you know he's probably not a great role model: ""The world is full of shitheads, Rhea. Don't listen to them--listen to me. And I know that Lou is one of those shitheads. But I listen."" 
 If this book has a theme I think it's something to do with how people change as they get older. ""Time is a goon"" was quoted in two different chapters, and if it means ""goon"" as in a thug, then the implication is that time ""beats us up' - or changes us - as our lives go on. We remain the same people underneath, but we are defined by the experiences we have, and the more time we live the more life shapes us into totally different people. 
 In the last chapter I loved the concept of the parrots - or people who sell out and endorse a product to create ""authentic"" word of mouth. As someone who is building a social network I think this is an interesting perspective, and one that I think is definitely a trend. It's nothing even new - celebrities have been selling out and taking money to endorse products for a long time. 
 But what is new is that celebrities aren't the only ones with followings anymore. Now with Facebook and Twitter and other social networks (yes, even Goodreads), regular people can amass hundreds and even thousands of friends. And maybe instead of paying one celebrity with 100K followers to promote something you pay 100 people with 1K followers. Indeed this is already starting - some friends of mine helped start Ad.ly - which lets you buy celebrities tweets.",4,5,1,395,35.33,52.14,78.84,75.4,18.81,18.48,89.37,71.9,58.48,13.67,8.86,3.54,2.28,0.76,0.76,1.01,4.81,13.67,6.33,3.8,12.41,9.11,6.58,9.37,1.52,16.2,6.08,5.57,5.57,3.04,0.51,2.03,13.67,1.77,11.9,4.3,1.52,0.25,2.53,0.76,4.56,0.0,4.05,3.54,0.0,0.51,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51,13.67,4.3,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.77,9.11,0.0,0.51,0.0,1.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.29,1.01,0.0,1.27,1.01,0.0,1.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.76,8.35,7.59,1.01,0.25,6.33,0.0,0.76,0.25,4.56,4.05,6.58,0.25,0.51,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,17.97,5.57,3.54,0.0,0.0,1.77,7.09,0
"A very interesting book about John Boyd, who was a crack fighter pilot, and then later military strategist and reformer. Boyd flew as an instructor in the real life version of Top Gun, and beat everyone in 40 seconds or less. But later in his life he really studied military strategy, and this is where the interesting parts of this book are. 
 Boyd was literally the designer of the F-15, and a theory of maneuvering called Energy-Manueverability (E-M), which mathematically gave a chart for each aircraft that gave pilots an idea of the ideal speeds and altitudes they could use to pull off various turns and tactics. 
 One interesting thing I noted was that throughout his career, like everyone else in the military, Boyd was getting reviewed by his superiors, called ER's. It was interesting to hear, and relevant to business, how you had to ""read through the lines"" and how even a positive sounding ER could be a career-killer if the person wasn't recommended for promotion. Reading this has definitely made me think twice every time I've read (or written) recommendations for people. 
 Another Boyd tidbit I liked was when fighting bureaucratic battles in the Pentagon, he had a mantra to ""use the other persons information against him"". Starting with the other persons argument and data, and working backwards, you can make pretty compelling arguments. 
 Perhaps the biggest idea Boyd came up with is what is called the OODA loop, which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. A key quote defining the OODA loop: 
 ""Thinking about operating at a quicker tempo - not just moving faster - than the adversary was a new concept in waging war. Generating a rapidly changing environment - that is, engaging in activity that is quick it is disorienting and appears uncertain or ambiguous to the enemy - inhibits the adversary's ability to adapt and causes confusion and disorder that, in turn, causes an adversary to overreact or underreact. Boyd closed the briefing by saying the message is that whoever can handle the quickest rate of change is the one who survives."" 
 Another great quote that helps explain it: 
 ""Boyd said the strategies and bloodbaths of World War 1 were the natural consequence of both the vo Clausewitzian battle philosophy and the inability of generals to adapt new tactics to nineteenth-century technology: line abreast, mass against mass, and linear defenses against machine guns and quick-firing artillery. The bankrupt nature of that doctrine was demonstrated on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, which the British suffered sixty thousand casualties. After more than three years of the meat-grinding form of war, the Germans began engagements with a brief artillery barrage with smoke and gas obscuring their intentions, then sent in a special infantry teams. These small groups looked for gaps in the defense and advanced along many paths. They did not hit strong points but instead went around them, pressing on, always going forward and not worrying about their flanks. They were like water going downhill, bypassing obstacles, always moving, proving, and then, when they found an opening, pouring through, pressing deeper and deeper."" 
 Getting your lieutenants to the point where they can do this kind of infiltration successfully requires great communication and men who can think fast on their feet. In other words, you had to enable every leader to be able to follow the OODA loop, and just arm them with the overal goals, and trust them to make their own decisions. Very different from previous military structures, where ""the need to know"" remained at the top. 
 Why is this empowerment valuable? Because: 
 ""The key thing to understand about Boyd's version is the not the mechanical cycle itself, but rather the need to execute the cycle in such fashion as to get inside the mind and the decision cycle of the adversary. This means the adversary is dealing with out-dated or irrelevant information and thus becomes confused and disoriented and can't function."" 
 And: 
 ""Understanding the OODA loop enables a commander to compress time - that is, the time between observing a situation and taking an action. A commander can use the temporal discrepancy (a form of fast transient) to select the least-expected action rather than what is predicted to be the most effective action. The enemy can also figure out what might be the most effective. To take the least-expected action disorients the enemy. It causes him to pause, wonder, to question."" 
 This makes sense. You can almost picture the commanders of old, who used to have to get on the phone with their boss in order make any decision. ""Take the bridge, blow it up, or wait?"". Hours and days could be spent waiting around for generals to make up their minds. This form of maneuver warfare is what the Germans used in WWII - they called it blitzkrieg - and it's what we used in Iraq the first time. 
 In business we have a word for the above - micromanagement. In a sense, it sounds like empowering business leaders and their lieutenants to have an effective OODA loop is what will let a business move faster and win marketshare. I bet somebody has written a book about that - I will have to look.",5,4,1,866,82.43,46.9,63.19,13.97,22.79,24.02,88.11,66.63,52.77,9.82,4.73,0.69,0.23,0.58,0.81,1.85,5.08,16.63,10.28,1.27,13.86,6.81,4.27,6.81,0.69,16.05,5.77,3.12,5.54,0.58,1.62,3.35,17.21,0.92,16.17,4.16,3.23,1.73,2.89,0.46,4.39,0.0,5.66,2.54,3.12,0.69,0.0,0.69,0.12,0.23,0.0,0.0,10.51,4.62,0.23,0.0,1.73,0.0,1.96,6.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.92,1.73,0.92,0.35,0.46,3.23,0.0,0.0,2.77,0.92,0.12,0.69,0.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12,0.12,1.39,0.0,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.46,0.12,0.81,4.27,9.93,0.46,2.66,6.0,0.69,0.35,0.23,4.62,5.08,3.93,1.15,0.12,0.0,0.0,0.12,0.0,16.05,4.27,5.43,0.23,0.0,0.81,5.31,0

"I learned two major things from this book: the power of branding, and the fact that Richard Branson has balls of solid steel. 
 Branson is one of the great entrepreneurs of our era, and it was truly inspiring to hear his story in his own words. A kid who skipped college and dove straight into business, and time and time again proved he can succeed with a lot of will, determination, and his maverick ability to take big bets and win. Bransons' success is nothing short of inspirational. 
 I had no idea until reading this how powerful the Virgin brand is, or how many businesses they have gone into. They effectively function like a VC, except they also lend their brand (and perhaps some infrastructure too). Each business is a subsidiary, given its leaders the freedom to move fast and achieve their goals without being slown down by needing permission from the mother ship. This is brilliant. Many of the businesses also complement each other in profitable ways - such as how Virgin Travel and Virgin Atlantic complemented each other. 
 Branson is a risk-taker. When Virgin Records was about to run out of cash, instead of scraping what he had left to limp on, he scraped it together to make a big bet. It's kind of like going all-in in poker when your chips are getting low - better than losing slowly! 
 ""I have always believed that the only way to cope with a cash crisis is not to contract but to try to expand out of it."" 
 But the difference with Branson is that he didn't take the risks blindly. When he started the airlines he spent considerable effort leasing the airline for 1 year and limiting his downside. 
 It is only by being bold that you get anywhere. If you are a risk-taker, then the art is to protect the downside."" 
 One thing I loved about Branson, is he was not afraid to bluff. This was first illustrated early in the book when, learning about a plot to force him out of Student, he acted pre-emptively and told the leader that he had already switched the teams mind - when instead he had no idea how far along the plot actually was. We see this time and time again - Branson is able to divine where things are going, and negotiate on points he isn't even wholly sure about. 
 Branson detailed a lot of his crazy ballooning adventures, which I wasn't so into. I wanted to hear how he built Virgin. Although I did appreciate that his passion for ballooning did lead to several advances in airplane technology. 
 The end of the book went into a lot of detail of how Branson is giving back to the world - which I respect a lot - any billionaire worth their salt should do that, but it was great to see him embrace the challenges with the same zeal he embrace business. From climate change to Virgin Fuel to Virgin Galactic, Branson is thinking hard about our planet and where its going and how to get us there. And of course, if Virgin Fuel does well it will only help his airline business - so not a bad bet.",39,5,1,532,48.35,50.13,25.39,75.77,20.46,18.8,89.29,70.49,59.21,13.35,8.27,1.5,0.75,0.56,4.14,1.13,5.08,15.98,6.77,1.13,14.47,8.27,8.08,6.95,1.69,14.66,6.02,4.7,6.58,1.88,2.82,2.07,14.66,0.75,13.91,3.2,2.26,0.94,2.82,0.94,4.51,0.0,5.64,4.51,0.94,1.32,0.75,0.38,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.53,2.63,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,8.08,0.19,0.0,0.19,4.14,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.19,5.45,0.38,0.0,3.38,3.01,0.0,2.26,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.19,0.0,1.5,0.19,0.0,0.38,0.19,0.94,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.94,1.13,0.94,5.83,8.08,0.0,2.26,4.7,0.56,0.38,0.19,3.38,5.08,4.14,1.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.59,4.7,3.57,0.0,0.19,0.94,3.2,0
"Just heard a talk by Chip which was very inspirational. He talked a lot about Abraham H. Maslow's hierarchy, and how it can be applied to employees, customers, and investors. Employee pyramid is: salary => recognition => calling. I thought his principles were similar to Tony Hsieh's book Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose. He even mentioned this was true, and that Tony and 10 other companies that had great culture had all studied Maslow (Apple, Southwest, Google, Whole Foods, Zappos, etc). 
 The top of any pyramid is hard for most business leaders because it's the self-actualization - the intangible stuff, which can't be measured. And most business leaders are taught to run things by the numbers. Told a story to illustrate this about why Southwest doesn't charge fees for checking baggage. It's because they didn't want to make their flight attendants into baggage handlers - which is what happens on other airlines, where everyone tries to carry everything on to save money. Southwest flight attendants are happier than other airlines, and this leads to less employee turnover and higher customer retention. Which saves them money in the long run - it's just impossible to measure. He also noted that the hospital industry did an extensive survey of what the top hospitals in the nation had in common. The results: the nurses were happier and more involved in each one. 
 Looking forward to the actual book, of which I now have a copy!",2,0,1,241,56.14,47.44,18.98,59.26,16.07,27.39,85.48,64.73,52.7,12.45,3.73,0.83,0.0,0.0,1.66,1.24,8.71,15.35,7.05,0.83,11.62,9.54,4.56,5.39,1.24,14.94,8.71,4.56,1.66,0.0,0.83,1.24,13.28,1.24,12.03,1.66,3.32,1.24,0.41,0.0,5.39,0.0,2.49,2.49,0.0,1.66,1.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.2,2.07,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07,8.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.66,0.83,0.41,0.0,0.41,9.54,0.0,0.0,9.13,3.32,0.0,1.66,1.24,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.41,0.41,3.73,9.13,0.0,1.24,6.64,0.41,0.41,0.41,0.41,5.81,5.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.16,5.81,6.22,0.0,0.41,3.32,5.39,0
"The Name of the Rose is a thrilling Dan Brown-esque murder mystery set in a 14th century Italian monastery. It really is two stories - the story of the murder mystery, and that of political climate in Italy at the time. And of course, they nicely interweave throughout. 
 The history the book brought was one of my favorite parts. I learned about how the church controlled so much of the world, how even then it was already starting to fall from power, why saints are so prevalent in Italy, and more. I learned about Franciscans and Dolcians and minorites, and poverity and false monks. Poverty was a big theme, which came through on several levels: rebellions by poor people and religious leaders stepping in to lead the masses, and also an a debate about the role the Church should have in society. 
 I loved brother William of baskerville. He was Sherlock Holmes-esque (so that can't be a coincidence he's from Baskerville right?) in his deductive reasoning and approach. I think my favorite moment of his was when he had no time left to solve the crime he said ""when a man has little time, he must take care to maintain his calm. We must act as if we had eternity before us."" 
 I took one star off because I often found myself skipping large sections that went into flowery details of something (often history) that just seemed irrelevant. 
 The book was also a lot about change. The monks were so set in their ways and in their dogma that you could see how it likely took generations before a viewpoint could really change. The focus on humor for instance and the dogmatic viewpoint of Jorge was in my opinion simply nothing more than fear of change. We all know that the introduction of humor and the divine comedy didn't ruin the world. 
 The library was one of the greatest in the world at the time. I would love to have seen it. Yet it was almost impossible to access, and that very lack of accessibility is what ultimately led to it's destruction. Seems like the message is that knowledge should be open and free and and keeping it locked up can be more dangerous than not.",17,3,1,375,53.32,46.37,42.42,53.27,17.86,19.2,89.07,69.87,59.73,12.0,7.2,2.93,1.07,0.27,2.13,0.8,4.8,16.53,9.07,1.33,14.4,9.33,7.47,8.8,1.33,15.47,5.33,4.53,4.8,1.87,0.53,2.67,17.33,0.8,16.27,4.8,3.2,3.2,2.93,1.33,2.4,0.0,5.87,4.0,1.87,1.33,1.07,0.27,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.13,3.73,0.27,0.0,0.53,0.0,1.33,6.4,0.27,0.0,0.0,2.67,0.53,0.27,0.27,0.0,3.47,0.27,0.0,1.07,0.27,1.87,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.53,0.0,0.8,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27,1.07,5.33,7.2,0.27,1.33,5.33,0.53,0.0,0.0,5.6,7.2,3.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,5.33,2.67,0.27,0.0,1.07,2.67,0
"An extremely well-written account of the 2008 financial collapse. It explained complex ideas like subprime mortgage bonds and CDO's in a clear way, and almost read like a fast paced thriller. 
 Essentially it seems that a bad ratings system and human greed created an economy that fostered the creation of a lot of bad debts, that eventually went bad, and caused a lot of big companies to go under (Lehman brothers, Bear Sterns), or require a bailout (Goldman Sachs, AIG). This is the real crime. These big companies were so focused on short term profits that they failed to see that long term what they were doing wasn't going to work. They should be appropriately punished for this, and instead many of them were saved by Uncle Sam. Would we have had a worse recession if Obama hadn't done that? Maybe. Maybe not. Lewis should write another book about that :) 
 Let me see if I can get this right. The book explains that mortgages are sold by the banks that issue them, passing off the risk. Mortgages are aggregated into groups in mortgage bonds, which are then packaged into tranches, which are rated by agencies such as Moody's and S&P's. The math was complex, but apparently somehow tranches that consisted almost entirely of ""subprime"" (aka risky) mortgages were being given high A ratings. I guess the theory was that by spreading out the risk across lots of mortgage bonds it lowered the risk. Too bad this didn't work. 
 Many of these mortgages were the variety that started 2 year fixed then went floating. They were largely taken out in 2005 - 2006, and as they hit 2 years the interest rates jumped as they went floating, and hoards of people defaulted. This explains why we teetered in 2007 and crashed in 2008. One of my favorite quotes to illustrate the madness: 
 ""In Bakersfield, California, a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house for $724,000."" 
 And it wasn't just in Bakersfield. All over the country people were taking out loans that were too big for their britches, because the banks were encouraging it: 
 ""The simple measure of sanity in housing prices, Zelman argued, was the ratio of median home price to income. Historically, in the United States, it ran around 3:1; by late 2004, it had risen nationally, to 4:1. ""All these people were saying it was nearly as high in some other countries,"" says Zelman. ""But the problem wasn't just that it was four to one. In Los Angeles it was ten to one and in Miami, eight-point-five to one."" 
 Economics is about incentives, and this book explained how they went very awry. But it was also a story about greed, and how even unintelligent people made a lot of money by riding the subprime mortgage train. The book followed several investors who noticed what was happening, but when they tried to tell people and test their ""crazy"" hypothesis that the financial world was going to collapse, they were mocked or ignored. So they just ended up shorting (betting against) the whole thing to make some money, which is what a good investor does. 
 ""What are the odds that people will make smart decisions about money if they don't need to make smart decisions--if they can get rich making dumb decisions?"" 
 I think the lesson in the end is that if it looks to good to be true, it is. That, and we need smarter people working at the ratings agencies.",16,5,1,599,55.63,34.36,39.78,16.43,18.72,18.2,90.15,71.12,55.09,12.52,4.34,0.83,0.5,0.0,0.17,2.67,8.18,16.03,7.18,3.51,12.85,8.68,5.84,6.34,1.34,18.36,5.84,6.84,2.67,0.83,1.34,0.5,12.85,0.67,12.19,3.17,1.67,1.34,3.01,0.5,4.17,0.0,3.84,1.67,2.0,1.67,0.67,0.83,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.0,8.01,3.01,0.17,0.0,0.17,0.5,1.0,4.84,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.33,0.17,0.0,8.85,0.0,1.84,4.01,5.68,0.0,0.67,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.83,0.5,7.18,8.68,0.5,2.17,5.51,0.67,0.0,0.0,2.34,9.35,3.17,1.0,0.33,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.53,5.01,5.51,0.33,0.0,1.5,6.18,0
"** spoiler alert ** 
 An interesting book in terms of it's structure: 5 distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways, then wind back out. This way of doing the structure was unique, and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together. But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary. 
 I generally don't try to summarize novels in my reviews, but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful. 
 Story 1: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose). Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of. 
 Story 2: Robert Frobisher. Perhaps my favorite story - about a penniless young musician who as a last-ditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician, Vyvyan Ayrs. The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA's wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. 
 Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. 
 Story 4: Timothy Cavendish. Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit, then the author's mafia-esque family get's on his case and he's on the run. He lands in a old-persons home/prison. This story is kind of a nightmare, and is revealed to be a movie in the next story. 
 Story 5: Somni 451. One of favorites, for how different it was. Set in the far future in an asian country, humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves. This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs - but our protagonist, Somni, breaks through and becomes self-conscious. The scary thing is I can easily see this happening! Told as recollections in an interview. 
 Story 6: Sloosha's Crossin'. Story of Zach'ry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii. Somni is now their deity. Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes. 
 All six stories were very graphic and real, and had extremely good character development. Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I can't describe here. 
 I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book. Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it, the major theme was freedom and slavery. Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain, Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys, Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians, Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home, Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom, and Zach'ry's people were captured and enslaved. All the stories touched on various ways people can ""enslave"" and control other people for various reasons. 
 I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings, but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves. Sounds good anyways, so I'll stick with that - but am interested to hear what other people thought.",7,4,1,645,81.99,43.72,27.86,20.23,16.54,22.02,85.12,62.02,50.54,9.15,5.74,2.02,0.62,0.16,1.4,0.78,3.41,15.35,9.15,2.17,14.11,7.6,4.19,6.36,0.47,13.18,7.29,2.48,5.89,1.55,0.78,3.88,10.85,0.47,10.39,2.02,1.4,1.55,2.17,0.47,3.57,0.16,5.27,2.64,2.64,1.09,0.62,0.47,0.16,0.31,0.0,0.0,13.33,7.13,0.16,0.47,0.47,0.47,5.12,5.89,0.31,0.0,0.78,0.93,0.31,0.0,0.16,0.16,3.57,0.62,0.47,2.17,0.31,0.0,0.78,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.62,0.16,0.62,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.47,0.62,4.03,9.77,0.47,1.24,6.2,0.93,0.31,0.47,2.79,4.81,4.34,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.43,5.89,4.34,0.0,0.16,2.02,4.03,0
"This is a book that every entrepreneur definitely needs to read, and everyone who works even remotely with Facebook needs to read. It does a simply amazing job going behind the scenes of Facebook and describing where the site came from, how it got to where it is, and where it's going. 
 The author had amazing inside access to Mark Zuckerberg and other key Facebook employees and investors. Very smart of Facebook to include David so often - it makes their story fully open, which is consistent with the values of their company - not to mention good PR. 
 The biggest takeaway I had was that Zuckerberg actually has much more of a vision and philosophy than I gave him credit for. The basic vision for Facebook is that it's a communication tool. It's very interesting to see that they think of it as a utility tool and not a media destination (like MySpace no doubt does). It means they are not afraid of sending traffic away from their site as long as they provide value up front - something that has been crucial to their success. 
 Zuckerbergs philosophy however is more interesting - he believes being open is better and will lead to a better society. He thinks the internet will inevitably enable this anyways, so Facebook might as well lead the charge. It's an interesting and idealistic philosophy - basically that it's really hard for a person to be dishonest or immoral in any way if their whole life is laid open to their friends. In fact, one has to strive to be an even better person, because everything we do is not being tracked and if it isn't already online, it will be soon. The books we read, the things we buy, the people we date, the places we go, the people we associate with - all this is online, and defines who we are. Would my future children be proud of me if they examined my life's consumption? If I knew they were going to do so, would I make better choices? Absolutely. 
 However the privacy road has rocked many people's worlds who haven't gotten the hint yet and EVERYTHING you put online, whether on Facebook or a seeming private place elsewhere, is ultimately public. The chapter on privacy listed many of these horror stories, and I certainly know more than a few stories of people who have been burned by having an inappropriate photo on Facebook or tweeting something inappropriate. The road to openness is happening - and I think Mark is right that it's going to make us better as a society. The danger, however, is that it will still cause many people a lot of pain as we get there - and may cause many to ultimately retreat from Social Networking (and the internet). I think Mark knows his responsibility there as his service depends on it, and I hope he's a good steward, as this is certainly a topic we debate a lot at Goodreads. 
 I worked in Social Networking during the Rise of Facebook - my company, Tickle, is even mentioned a few times in the book. This book made the mistakes we made at Tickle even more apparent. Hindsight is a ...! For instance, starting with colleges that were *private* was what really worked - everyone had no problems sharing everything with their fellow classmates and alums. 
 Facebook's biggest product innovation though was of course Platform. Followed perhaps by the Like button and Facebook Connect - which are really only possible because so many people use Facebook. Both were big wins, and were interesting pushed hard by Zuckerberg, and their success really validated him as a leader internally. 
 One interesting note that I hadn't considered was that because everyone uses their real names on Facebook, blogs that use Facebook Connect for comments (eg Huffington Post) don't have the troll problem as much, because of the openness issue (see above). 
 The book was also very interesting as it gave a lot of the details of how Facebook was financed, how the VC deals were structured, what sort of offers it got, etc. Zuckerberg was courted to sell by so many large companies, I had always wondered how he had the nerve to say no - most in his shoes would have sold out for millions or billions long ago. The answer seems to be that he doesn't really value money, and also that he knows this is his big Life's Opportunity to change the world - and to sell now would be to squander it. 
 The book also gave interesting insight into where Facebook thinks they are going. In the future they think they will be less of a destination site, and more of a social communication enabler. Everything that can be social will be, and it will be done with Facebook. Every website you visit, your TV, video games, and perhaps even your cereal box will one day have Facebook Connect.",33,5,1,817,28.97,58.99,22.48,52.36,22.69,20.44,90.21,73.93,60.59,14.57,7.71,1.84,1.35,0.49,1.47,2.08,6.85,16.03,6.98,0.61,11.75,11.26,7.47,7.83,1.47,20.2,6.98,5.51,4.16,1.84,1.96,0.61,16.52,1.59,14.81,3.18,3.06,1.35,3.3,2.57,3.18,0.12,4.04,3.06,0.98,1.1,0.73,0.37,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.12,3.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,1.47,7.83,0.0,0.24,0.0,1.47,1.35,0.0,0.0,1.35,3.92,0.49,0.0,2.82,0.73,0.0,0.49,0.12,0.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.61,0.24,0.49,0.24,0.12,0.0,0.37,0.24,1.22,6.49,7.59,0.12,1.1,5.26,0.61,0.0,0.61,2.2,5.14,6.49,2.82,0.24,0.12,0.12,0.0,0.0,14.2,4.41,4.65,0.24,0.12,1.96,2.82,0
"Tony Hsieh has some nerve suggesting that he built a billion dollar company in pursuit of happiness. But the surprising thing is I actually think he's onto something. Something that cuts through a lot of corporate BS and really makes sense. 
 Tony's thesis is basically that, whatever our intermediate goals in life are (get your dream job, make a lot of money, find the right girl, etc), our ultimate goal is simply to be happy. And what's more, (this is the key), happiness in life has to come from your job as much as your personal life. 
 Tony lays out a framework for how he personally has used happiness to create a very unique and successful culture at Zappos - and how he personally came to that conclusion in his own life. 
 I heard Tony Hsieh speak several years ago, and from that had one key takeaway: that instead of spending marketing dollars acquiring customers, just have mind-blowing WOWingly good customer service - and your product will spread naturally - as people will tell their friends about their good experiences. It's harder to calculate the ROI, but it's something that makes a lot of sense, and we've definitely incorporated it into Goodreads. 
 Tony's Happiness frameworks has four pieces: 
 1. Perceived control: people need to be in control over their own fate. At Zappos reps can earn up to 20 different skill sets or ""badges"", and each one represents a pay raise. It's up to the employee how much money they want to make. 
 2. Perceived progress: nobody likes to feel like they aren't going anywhere. At Zappos they give smaller raises every 6 months instead of bigger ones annually. 
 3. Connectedness. Studies show that engaged employees are more productive, and the number of good friends an employee has at work is correlated with how engaged the employee is. I found this one most interesting. 
 4. Vision/Meaning/High Purpose. People need to believe in something bigger than themselves. The book Good to Great discusses how the truly great companies in terms of long term financial performance are those with higher purposes beyond making money. This I do believe, which is why on the Goodreads about us page our mission is stated as ""to get people excited about reading"". 
 Other things I learned about Tony that were interesting: 
 - Tony walked away from $20 million dollars because he didn't want to waste a year being miserable working for Microsoft. 
 - Tony spent every cent he made from the $265 million LinkExchange acquisition in keeping Zappos afloat. Again - admirable. 
 Things I learned about Zappos that were interesting: 
 - The Zappos Core Values actually help the company quite a lot, as they've made believing in their core values a core value. 
 - The Core values are the way to keep the culture strong, because they are guidelines for people hiring to keep the desired qualities and traits. Each core value has different interview questions, and employees try to gauge new candidates on each value using these questions.

"I was pleased, but not satisfied to have read this book. In truth - it was too short! This is a great primer, but I hope someone can convince David Sokol to do a more in depth version, as I think there is a lot more we can learn from him. 
 It kind of felt like I was getting macro board-level type coaching on the philosophy of how to create and manage a successful business. I saw the same themes popping up that I see in other places, such as Tony Hsieh's new Delivering Happiness book, Four Steps to the Epiphany, and even the lean startup. Clearly all businesses have parallels in terms of the best ways to run them - and equally clearly David Sokol knows his stuff. 
 My Notes 
 Chapter II: Core Principles 
 * Customer commitment: Sokol believes a business should have a core principle to put the customer first. This is a theme I've heard from a number of CEO's of respected companies, and one I truly believe in. Make sure to remember that anyone your business deals with is a customer - that includes not just consumers, but also suppliers, partners, etc. 
 * Employee commitment: also a core value focus to provide the best workplace possible. Don't hire employees unless the existing team is already operating at 125% capacity - it isn't fair to hire people then have to lay them off later. Keep a notebook on each direct report's successes/failures each month. Communicate constantly to ensure each report knows if they are meeting expectations. Rank employees. 
 * Financial Strength: often not given enough everyday focus. Must have ever-vigilant focus on margins, balance sheet, and avoiding future risks. 
 * Integrity: (I'm comforted that this is a core value). When hiring he looks for integrity, intellect, and passion. Enron, Worldcom and Tyco failed because of a lack of integrity at the highest level. Warren Buffet uses the question ""Would I be comfortable for my action to be disclosed in a front page story on my hometown paper, written by a knowledgeable and thorough reporter and read by all my friends and family?"" 
 Chapter III: Goal Setting and Budgeting 
 * Do a 10 year plan once a year. The plan won't be useful for more than a few years, but it's a good exercise to think at a macro level. 
 * ""It is the discipline of setting goals, coupled with consistent fact based measurement, that creates great outcomes in business or in personal life"". 
 * Set goals annually and measure them monthly. Get the whole team doing this. 
 Chapter IV: Plan, Execute, Measure, and Correct 
 * Plans are often under-described. Each detail must be described, along with how it will be measured. 
 * Plans often, and by necessity, include assumptions. It is critical these assumptions be documented as such, the risks clearly described, so that they can be measured and verified later. Assumptions must be verified! 
 * ""Verifying that a plan is being executed properly and that all activities are on budget and on schedule is not micromanaging, it is MANAGING.""",3,5,1,500,58.28,28.01,40.54,83.36,16.13,25.0,86.0,65.8,51.6,10.0,4.8,2.8,0.2,0.2,0.6,1.0,5.2,15.0,7.0,1.2,11.4,9.8,4.2,6.8,1.4,17.6,6.2,5.2,6.2,1.4,3.8,1.4,16.0,0.8,15.0,4.8,1.2,2.6,3.0,2.0,3.4,0.2,4.2,4.2,0.0,1.2,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.4,3.6,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.6,5.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.8,0.0,0.2,6.0,2.4,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.6,0.2,0.4,0.0,1.0,0.6,0.8,4.4,7.6,1.6,1.0,4.4,0.8,0.2,0.2,3.6,2.6,5.6,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.4,5.6,5.6,0.2,0.4,1.8,6.8,0

"It was nice to be back in Africa, even for a short time. This was a beautifully written memoir, and a remarkable glimpse into what Africa was like a century ago. I fear the Africa Dinesen described is long gone. 
 I picked this up tainted by having seen the movie first, and was kind of glad and surprised at the differences. The fact that she almost doesn't even mention her husband, who was so prominent in the film, I think would have been strange even to those who hadn't seen the movie. Also the way she described her romances was so proper one wasn't sure for some time if they were friends or something more. 
 The language used to describe the culture in the early 1900's, and the relationship between the Natives and the Europeans, was very interesting. At times you'd read over sentences that just wouldn't fly today, and you'd have to remember this was describing a different time - one where slavery existed, and Kenya was still a British Colony. What was clear however was that Karen Blixen cared deeply for the Native people that she encountered. 
 One thing I found interesting was the legal system the Kikuyu used. Instead of attempting to judge guilt or innocence, they Kikuyu simply demanded payment from the wrong-doer for whatever damages they had done. In the book, the parents of the child who accidentally shoots another child are forced to pay for their childs mistake, even though it was as accident. In todays world, the parents of the shot child would sue the heck out of the parents of the other child, so I suppose in that case the end effect is the same. There are many places where I'm sure this system would break down, and I'd love to discuss it over a few drinks with a lawyer. But I did have to admire the simplicity of it - if you cause another person to have a loss (for whatever reason), you have to make up for it. 
 The novel was full of funny little tidbits, all designed to help you get a sense of the people and the world as she saw it. The Merchant of Venice story (p268) stuck out for me - it was hilarious! Here are the relevant lines: 
 ""But what else could he do?"" I asked , ""when he must not take one drop of blood?"" 
 ""Memsahib"", said Farah, ""he could have used a red-hot knife. That brings out no blood."" 
 ""But"", I said ""he was not allowed to take either more or less than one pound of flesh."" 
 ""And who"", said Farah, ""would have been frightened by that, exactly a Jew? He might have taken little bits at at a time, with a small scale at hand to weight it on, till he had got just one pound. Had the Jew no friends to give him advice?""",9,5,1,479,55.23,40.06,15.49,45.34,19.16,13.99,91.44,73.28,61.59,13.78,7.72,2.3,0.0,1.04,2.71,0.84,6.05,17.33,10.02,1.88,13.78,11.69,5.22,6.26,1.67,19.0,6.05,5.64,3.55,1.88,0.0,1.67,12.94,0.63,12.32,1.46,1.88,2.3,2.71,0.42,5.01,0.21,4.38,2.92,1.25,1.88,1.04,0.63,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.94,4.8,0.84,0.0,0.0,0.42,2.71,7.93,0.84,0.42,1.25,1.67,1.04,0.21,0.84,0.0,2.3,0.84,0.0,0.63,0.63,0.42,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,1.46,0.42,1.04,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.21,1.04,7.1,8.14,0.21,1.04,6.05,0.63,0.0,0.21,1.67,9.6,2.09,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.95,4.18,5.43,0.84,0.21,1.88,5.43,0
"I cracked and finally picked this up. Very enjoyable quick read - couldn't put it down - it was like crack. 
 I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. 
 I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there. 
 All in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.",24,5,1,238,59.33,47.53,64.51,31.82,18.31,16.81,89.08,72.27,58.82,10.92,5.88,2.94,0.84,1.26,0.0,0.84,5.04,16.39,6.3,0.0,14.29,10.5,5.88,6.3,0.42,18.49,6.72,5.46,6.72,3.78,0.84,2.1,15.97,1.68,14.29,4.2,2.94,2.1,2.94,1.68,2.1,0.0,7.56,4.2,3.36,1.26,1.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.98,4.62,2.1,0.0,1.26,0.84,0.0,4.62,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,2.1,1.26,0.0,0.84,0.0,0.0,1.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.84,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.42,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.68,4.62,10.92,0.0,2.1,8.4,0.42,0.0,0.42,2.52,4.62,4.2,2.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.76,4.62,2.94,0.84,0.0,1.26,2.1,0

"** spoiler alert ** 
 Critics aside, Dan Brown can sure write a thriller. I was stuck in an airport with no book and picked this up, and was done with it in 2 days. 
 The first half of the book was really gripping, and promised big things. We were going to learn about the secrets of the Masons, and about the ""ancient wisdom"" that has been lost through the ages. Sounds cool - I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom. But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom.

"A great read for anyone leading or working in a creative team. Delves into the stories of Xerox PARC, Disney, Bill Clinton's election, Black Mountain College, Skunk Works, and The Manhattan Project. Very interesting to read about all these epic creative groups. 
 I'm not sure I learned anything revolutionary in this book, but it did help drive home some ideas that I keep running across. 
 I think the major takeaway of the book is that great groups need a great purpose. If they believe in the purpose, and a few other things align, then great things can happen. Xerox was out to change the world by introducing the computer. Disney was going to tell stories and inspire imaginations like they've never been told or inspired before. Bill Clinton and his team believed in 
 The characteristics of a Great Group are: 
 * A huge mission. A massive sense of purpose. Great groups think they are on a mission from God. 
 * Superb people. Generalists not specialists. Creative problem solvers. 
 * A strong leader 
 * A leader who believes in the purpose passionately and can inspire others to see it as well. 
 * A leader who knows how to find talent and can recognize it 
 * A leader who can assemble personalities that will mesh 
 * A leader who optimizes the matching of each group member with the thing they are best at and most passionate about. 
 * A leader who shields the team from bureaucracy and fights for them. 
 * A place to call their own. Doesn't have to be nice, but has to be separate from everything else. 
 * An enemy. Great groups are competitive. 
 * Optimism. Optimists accomplish more and are happier. 
 * They get stuff done. Real artists ship. 
 The one criticism I have of the book is that there aren't nearly enough tangible methods presented. But there were a few: 
 * Steve Jobs is known for making Apple into such a strong brand it's almost cultish. One tactic he had for this was hiring evangelists such as Guy Kawasaki whose entire job was to ""keep the Apple cult alive"". 
 * PARC leader Bob Taylor had a good tactic for mediating disagreements - he ""would urge people to move from what he called a Class I disagreement, in which neither party could describe the other's position, to a Class 2 disagreement, in which each side could articulate the others stance."" 
 * At PARC they didn't just interview candidates, but they also required them to give a talk before the entire staff - and field sometimes sharp, probing questions.",1,4,1,413,70.54,57.39,27.17,91.11,13.77,19.13,89.1,67.8,53.27,11.86,6.3,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.97,2.42,5.57,15.5,9.69,0.48,12.35,8.96,3.39,5.57,1.69,16.95,8.72,2.91,7.02,1.69,2.42,3.39,17.19,1.21,15.98,4.6,1.94,1.94,2.66,0.97,4.6,0.0,7.99,6.54,1.45,1.45,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.5,5.81,1.21,0.0,1.45,0.0,2.18,10.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.21,1.69,0.97,0.0,0.73,7.75,0.48,0.24,6.3,0.0,0.73,0.48,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.24,0.48,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.69,6.54,6.78,0.0,0.73,4.84,0.73,0.0,0.24,1.45,4.36,5.08,1.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.16,7.26,3.39,0.0,0.0,1.94,5.57,0

"A business classic that everyone should read. Explains 20th century and 21st century economics from a big picture perspective. The basic thesis is that while in the physical world (atoms), products have cost and thus companies can afford to give away small amounts of free samples (5%), or give away cheaper loss-leader related products in order to maintain profits. In the digital world things are reversed as products have little to no marginal cost and companies can afford to give away 95% of the product for free and make money on the remaining 5%. 
 My Notes 
 * For physical products free is a marketing tactic. Give away one product to make money on another (cell phones to sell plans, razor blades to sell razors, jello cookbooks to sell jello, etc). This is the concept of a ""loss-leader"", and is the basis of much of 20th century marketing. 
 * Value psychology: things that were once paid have a difficult time going free because people think it must not be as valuable anymore. Things that have always been free can still have a high perceived value. 
 * The Penny-gap: The psychology of a free product versus that of a product costing even one cent is huge. Koppelman says many businesses can't make the leap. Study where truffle is $.15 and kiss is $.01 and 70% choose the truffle, then reduced to .14 and free and now 70% choose the kiss. Free is disposable so we can't make a bad decision by choosing it - it's a psychological thing. 
 * Products in a truly competitive market tend to fall to the marginal cost. A true competitive market was mostly an economic theory as most real economies have inefficiencies (the products are somehow differentiated). However with digital economies we finally have true competitive markets, with marginal costs so close to zero that it's often rounded down. 
 * Reputation and attention economies are other important things that motivate people. Time is money! People will pay for status or to save time in a game, even if they wouldn't pay for the entire thing. There has been an explosion in gaming lately as games become free to play then charge as people play (Habbo Hotel, WOW, Puzzle Pirates, Second Life, Club Pengiun, Runescape, etc) 
 * Giving away your product for free or allowing piracy can be a good thing if you can figure out how to make money from the attention you get as a result. Microsoft would rather people be using pirated versions of Windows & Office than be using a competitor - it establishes them as the market leader and leads to more sales. Bands in China and Brazil give away as many free copies of their album in towns they visit as possible to get everyone to buy a ticket to their concert. 
 * Google is the best example of the above. They make so much on advertising from their main product (search + advertising), that they can afford to hire thousands of engineers to work on dozens and dozens of quality products that don't need to make money, they just need to establish Google more as a brand people use (gmail, google docs, google calendar, google apps, youtube, blogger, google analytics, google ad manager, and many more)

"I read a bunch of Bond books in High School and hadn't read one since, so I really enjoyed this one. As I remember a few of them being, it was very different from the movie. Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit. 
 In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.",0,5,1,114,34.18,11.98,58.46,61.63,16.29,16.67,83.33,69.3,56.14,9.65,7.02,4.39,0.0,0.0,1.75,0.88,2.63,17.54,7.02,1.75,8.77,6.14,11.4,8.77,1.75,13.16,7.89,8.77,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.88,16.67,1.75,14.91,4.39,1.75,1.75,5.26,1.75,3.51,0.88,2.63,2.63,0.0,2.63,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.14,2.63,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.88,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.14,2.63,0.0,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.39,8.77,0.88,0.88,7.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.63,7.02,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.54,5.26,6.14,0.0,0.88,1.75,3.51,0

"As an engineer I couldn't help but love this book. It's full of logic games! The 3 rules of robotics are a very rich medium for lots of fun puzzles, and I very much enjoyed reading them. I think the book originally came out in serial form, as it was broken down into short stories or capers. Kind of reminded me of Sherlock Holmes - another favorite of mine. 
 Examining robots also gave a canvas for defining what it is to be human. I loved the robot religion story. Robots with a superiority complexes - but thank goodness for that first law or it would be a Terminator-style story. 
 According to Asimov's predictions, in 2009 the robot revolution should be in full swing. But I don't see a lot of robots around. Anyone have a good prediction on where we are with robots?

"A truly heartwarming story of riches to rags - I tore through it on a NY-LA flight. Highly recommended for anyone who works and wonders if they shouldn't be paying more attention to their personal happiness. Some great business anecdotes throw in from the authors experience in a top-tier advertising firm in NYC. But mostly this is a story that makes you question the sanity of giving your whole life to a corporation that can easily discard you when you get older. Definitely highlights the importance of doing what you love - even if its working at a coffee shop! 
 The other interesting bit was the culture of Starbucks. Instead of giving each other orders, employees are taught to ask each other to ""do me a favor"". They are taught to be 100% positive in everything they do, and to constantly positively reinforce their coworkers. Coworkers are actually called Partners, and patrons are Guests. The language we use is so key to setting the right tone!

"** spoiler alert ** 
 Kind of Dan Brown-esque but with a fun geek twist. And the geek in me enjoyed it. Would have given it four stars, but I didn't love the ending. It was a truly interesting premise though: A computer programmer dies of cancer and leaves behind a program that kicks into life when it sees his obituary in the news, and wreaks havoc with some unknown goal in sight. 
 In the first half of the book I had a lot of fun trying to imagine the program that Sobol wrote. It was basically a big logic tree, where each possibly outcome in the real world was accounted for in the program. It would have taken a lot of preparation and attention to detail to go through all the possible outcomes and not missing anything, and one bug could make the whole thing fail. Wouldn't that be embarrassing? I guess Sobol had some good unit tests? 
 In the second half of the book (trying to not give anything away), the AI goes beyond what I think a skilled programmer could do today. Certainly an interesting thought exercise, but playing up a little bit too much on our fear of ""oh my gosh all information is digital now so a hacker could just take out our whole society!"" Many a hacker has stayed up all night with the same thoughts! 
 What I really want to know is where I can get some of those voice projector/sensors?

"I'm a sucker for spy novels, so when someone left this at our bookswap brunch, I zero'd right in on it. I definitely enjoyed it, but didn't think it had much substance. However, it was a perfect novel to relax the mind. 
 I enjoyed the descriptions of East Berlin and West Berlin and the Anarchists and Communists. The descriptions of how the double agents were made was a lot of fun.

"One of the most enjoyable stories I've read in some time. Captain Jack Aubrey was a fascinating character. You just wanted him to succeed - to capture the Spanish vessel, to gain the respect of his men, to gain the respect of the Admiral. 
 The book is set during the Napoleonic Wars, and it was interesting to see all the Kings ships were nothing but glorified pirates, capturing all vessels they could on the open seas.

"A great book and worth the read, but like many Gladwellian books, it can be summed up easily. The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier. Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. 
 Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. 
 One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and ""couldn't find any 'naturals'"" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It's kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn't true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. 
 One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they're really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest?",5,4,1,365,39.7,53.14,37.99,63.38,20.28,15.89,91.78,73.42,59.18,13.97,8.49,2.74,0.55,0.55,1.64,2.74,5.48,16.71,6.3,3.01,12.33,10.41,6.03,7.4,0.82,15.34,9.04,6.85,6.3,1.37,4.38,1.37,13.42,1.64,11.78,2.74,1.1,1.37,1.92,0.82,3.84,0.0,4.38,3.56,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.32,0.27,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.49,0.55,0.0,0.0,1.64,0.55,0.0,0.0,0.55,7.95,1.92,0.0,5.21,0.82,0.0,0.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.82,0.0,0.55,7.4,8.22,0.55,0.55,5.75,0.27,0.55,0.27,3.84,6.03,4.11,0.27,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.0,15.34,4.66,4.93,0.27,0.0,1.64,3.84,0
"I enjoyed every second of this book. I haven't read a time travel book in a long time, but loved this one, as the descriptions of London in 1812 were very rich.

"I read this after hearing from a few people that it was among their all-time favorites. I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits, originally written as a tale by a father to his children - but I'm glad I wasn't. 
 I found the folk tales about El-ahrairah to be very impressive. The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history. But I think this book was worth reading as it's really a story about survival, leadership, and human nature.

"A great snapshot of history. It's about the experiences of ordinary French people as they flee Paris in 1940 when the Germans are invading. The second part is about after the Germans occupy France, how people in the towns get along with their hosts. 
 I loved the class breakdowns that occur. When the rules of society are no longer being enforced, having money or being a famous writer no longer make you more special than the next person. The descriptions of the characters prejudices, which were mostly based on their class, were really well done. 
 The story of the German officer falling in love with his French host took me a while to get into, but towards the end the emotions they both felt were really well described. You could really feel the how torn they were about it. 
 I went to a bookclub that discussed this book and was surprised to hear the variety of opinions on this book. The most interesting angle to me was: why did she paint such a positive picture of the Germans when she was of Jewish decent (and was indeed later killed in Auschwitz). Some people argued that she didn't yet know of the atrocities. Others thought maybe it was a hedge in case she was caught so she could show how sympathetic she was. And others thought she was just a writer caught up in telling a story.

"My safari guide gave this to me, saying the author was a friend who had lived a life similar to his own. It's a very well-written memoir style book of a man who is raised among a very proud people called the Maasai in East Africa. By modern standards they live very primitive lives: herding cattle, and living in dirt huts. But some of them are sent to school and enter the modern world, and the juxtaposition of the author's viewpoint on both worlds makes for a great read. 
 One interesting thing I noticed was that one reason the author was able to get so far in life was that as a safari guide back in the day, he met exclusively rich and powerful people as his clients. They were the only ones who could afford it back then!

"I learned a lot about an area of the world I knew very little. The book was a journalistic nonfiction account of Sierra Leone, as opposed to the fictional movie (which I also enjoyed). 
 Key takeaways: 
 - Human beings can be pretty indecent to each other when the economic incentives are right, and when there are no checks on those in charge. The RUF murdered and mutilated thousands. 
 - There is *no* way to verify a diamond is not a conflict diamond. No matter what a diamond seller says, stones are untraceable and black market stones can be added in at any of a dozen of places on the way from the mine to the store. Only stores like DeBeers, who control their own mines and stores, can approach such a guarantee. 
 - The guy who started DeBeers was impressive. He bought up as many mines as he could instead of mining them, and eventually controlled the market. DeBeers has had some shady practices as the worlds biggest diamond buyer and mine owner. 
 - DeBeers has a monopoly on diamonds, and as such can't have more than 3 executives in the US at any time or they will be arrested for prosecution by the SEC. 
 - DeBeers has a stockpile of diamonds in London worth billions. Selling it would flood the market. 
 - In late 2001, a Washington Post reporter broke a story that Osama Bin Laden had been buying conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone for a the past year to convert his money to a liquid form. This was in preparation for Sept 11, as he knew the US would seize his funds after the attack. Its very likely the scheme worked, and conflict diamonds are what is funding him today.",3,4,1,286,78.97,36.05,5.78,2.12,17.88,18.53,83.57,64.34,56.99,8.39,5.59,1.75,0.0,0.0,2.1,1.05,2.8,19.23,11.19,2.1,13.99,9.79,4.2,6.99,1.75,13.64,4.9,3.85,4.55,0.0,1.05,3.5,10.14,1.05,8.74,1.4,0.7,2.45,1.75,0.35,2.45,0.0,4.2,0.7,3.5,0.35,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.09,3.85,0.0,0.0,2.1,0.35,0.7,5.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.45,1.4,1.4,0.0,0.0,8.39,0.35,0.0,2.45,5.94,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,3.85,6.29,0.0,0.7,5.24,0.35,0.0,0.0,2.45,5.59,5.24,1.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.29,5.59,3.5,0.0,0.0,0.35,3.85,0

"Great book. Quick read, and you learn about about psychology that you can apply to life or business. 
 A few notes: 
 - All about first impressions. First impressions can sway our opinion of something for years to come regardless of subsequent performance. 
 - Labels matter. If you label someone as a higher performer, top of class, leader, having command potential, etc - it will translate into them actually having it. My high school motto was Principes Non Homines (leaders not men) - now I know why they thought that would work. 
 - When we brand or label people they take on the characteristics of the diagnosis. 
 - People are easily swayed when other people they deal with are decent or nice or fair to them. You enjoy a restaurant 10 times more if the waiter is really nice, regardless of the food (the product). Same goes for any service or business relationship. 
 - Heightened adrenaline levels lead to higher levels of romantic interest 
 - We have ""two engines"" running in our brain that don't operate simultaneously. So we usually approach things from either an altruistic perspective or a self-interested one. Money (self-interest) is not always the best motivator - sometimes pride (in your country, your city, what you do) will inspire people much more.",8,4,1,205,42.58,80.24,80.84,79.96,14.64,21.95,89.76,65.37,52.68,13.66,9.27,0.98,2.44,3.41,0.0,2.44,4.39,15.12,5.37,2.44,10.73,7.32,5.85,6.83,1.46,12.68,10.24,5.37,7.32,3.41,2.44,1.95,20.0,0.49,19.51,3.9,1.46,1.46,7.8,0.98,7.32,0.0,3.9,3.9,0.0,0.98,0.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.1,3.41,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,11.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.78,0.49,0.0,8.29,0.98,0.0,2.44,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.46,7.8,6.83,0.0,2.93,4.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.88,0.98,4.39,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.95,6.83,3.9,0.0,0.0,0.49,10.73,0
"Very fascinating take on how Leopold was able to obtain a colony many times bigger than Belgium with pure politics, and maintain it with forced slavery and mercenaries. 
 There are lots of business lessons to be learned from Leopold: 
 - Perception is reality. The reality was forced slavery, and unspeakable cruelty by Leopold's agents. But in Europe Leopold told over and over the story that he was a humanitarian, and had the best interests of the Congo people in mind. 
 - You can control reality. Leopold wined and dined, and even bribed anyone with the ability to hurt the perception he spun of the Congo. Harder to do today, but not impossible. For instance a web startup just has to get cozy with Arrington and funding is around the corner. Leopold wasn't a king - he was a master at PR. 
 - History is written by the victors. Most published accounts of the era came from Leopold or his agents. Thus most people had no idea what was happening. I've seen this in current times: an authoritative article by a prominent newspaper that gets things wrong - then for people later researching the subject it becomes a source, and the myth builds. Thats what good PR can do! 
 - Economic incentive without proper checks can result in just about anybody becoming corrupt. Lots of ""good"" people in the book did unspeakable things to the natives for the sake of meeting their quota of ivory or rubber, or because they were ordered to. Similar stories have been told of American soldiers in Vietnam. In my view this pretty much proves man is neither inherently good or evil, but is entirely motivated by peer pressure and/or money.

"I heard this book described as interesting but a little dry, so I was fully planning on just skimming a lot. But I ended up reading almost the whole thing! I have two biases though: one was I was in Africa at the time I read it, and the other is my grandfather did a lot of hunting in Africa in the 1960's, so I could almost picture him hanging out with the wild characters in the book. 
 What I loved were all the stories of hunts and the pioneer type hunters that led them. Numerous maulings and close calls dealing with all sorts of animals. Surprisingly, the most dangerous animals in Africa are (in order): Buffalo, Elephant, Leopard, Lion, Rhino. Unless you wound the Lion then he's #1.

"""Dr Livingstone, I presume!"" 
 That phrase was buried in my mind somewhere. It was familiar, yet I knew not how nor who this Livingstone person was. This book explained it, and was very entertaining in the process. Highly recommended if you ever travel to East Africa. 
 A friend recently wrote an interesting piece about how the types of creative people that rise to be famous have changed over the years. Livingstone was an explorer in the mid-1800's, and was a Michael Jordan of England. He explored much of Africa, often being the only white man in the expedition. He abhorred slavery, which was then rampant, and fought against it. His quest was to find the source of the Nile river, which evidently was a big thing back then (today we just keep looking for 'dark matter' and other such stuff). 
 But the most interesting part of the book to me was that the reason we know that famous phrase, is that its an early example of newspaper sensationalism. The New York Observer paid a reporter (Stanley) to take ridiculously large and expensive expedition into the middle of Africa that lasted for years, just to be able to have the exclusive on the story. But it was worth it: millions of Americans were entertained for years by the articles on Stanley's quest. And England wasn't happy its superstar was found by an American either, a fact not lost on the Observer.",4,5,1,240,70.17,26.5,74.02,66.2,17.14,19.17,86.67,72.5,57.92,12.5,4.58,1.67,0.83,0.42,1.25,0.0,7.92,18.33,10.83,0.83,12.92,8.33,5.42,5.42,1.67,15.0,7.92,4.17,3.33,0.83,2.08,1.25,15.0,1.25,13.75,4.58,2.08,0.42,1.67,0.42,5.83,0.0,6.25,4.58,1.67,1.67,1.25,0.42,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,8.33,2.92,0.0,0.42,0.42,0.42,0.83,5.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.08,1.25,0.0,1.25,0.0,3.33,0.83,0.0,1.25,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.92,5.0,8.33,0.83,1.67,4.17,2.08,0.0,0.0,5.42,9.58,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.83,5.42,4.58,0.0,0.42,2.08,3.33,0
"** spoiler alert ** 
 Just finished this and have to say I really enjoyed it. I was kind of worried the plot wasn't going anywhere for much of it, but the writing was really good and drew me in. 
 For much of the book I thought the main character (Richard) was too weak of a character for me to like much, but I liked how he grew in confidence towards the end. I think anytime one undertake's an adventure or a journey like that you grow so much. You have to get out there and fail a few times to have the confidence to know how to succeed! 
 I also have to say I loved Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar. Their dialogue and interaction was hilarious.

"I got an advanced copy of this and tore through it last weekend. It was a memoir style account of desert warfare in world war 2, and a fascinating and realistic account of what it was like. A little heavier on logistics (names/places/etc) in a few places than I would have liked, but that did make it seem very real. 
 I loved the descriptions of Rommel's tank tactics: ""tied in forces will hold and forces in the air will run"". It was also interesting to note that most of the special ops were doing recon - which today would be done via satellites. 
 My generation has never lived through a world war, and reading this really brought to light the fact that a war of that magnitude really changes a society. Everyone fights from famous rugby stars to oxford scholars to high school teachers. The only take-away is that war is fucked up and I hope we never have to do it again.

"An epic book - loved it, and wish I had found it before now. It does start a bit slow, but then really picks up. It's the story of a young man in 1905ish who graduates from Harvard and then is sent by his rich uncle to be the consul to the made up country of Islandia, which is closed to trade with the outside world. 
 Islandia is described so clearly you could almost believe it wasn't a made up country. You can feel it's beauty, it's pureness, and it's culure, coming through the pages. 
 Many of us went through idealistic phases in our 20's, and John Lang is no exception. He is trying to decide what will make him happy: Islandia, or a life in New York as a businessman. He is also searching for love, and seems to have a crush on every Islandian woman he meets! 
 Wright does an amazing job of describing what the Islandian culture is like. They are largely farmers: they work in the field all day, and their land provides what they need to eat and money to buy the rest. They don't have to work super hard, and have plenty of time for leisure. Their society closed and smaller, so people are very decent to each other. There aren't very many towns or central social hubs, so socializing is often accomplished by staying as a guest in someones farm house as you are traveling through the country, and you can do that totally unannounced. 
 Islandia is a utopia of sorts - they believe that progress in their culture will not lead to improving their lives. It is an interesting question - does technological progress actually end up making our lives better? Technology is supposed to improve the quality of our lives. We have better medicines, cleaner cities, we can communicate instantly around the world, and travel on cars and trains and planes. 
 But we lack the notion of a ""home"" that spans across generations or even multiple family units. Cousins and uncles and grandparents are only seen several times a year during family parties and holidays. In a sense, our society has shifted from being family centric to friend centric, as friends are the people we hang out with socially in the cities, where most of us live.

"** spoiler alert ** 
 I absolutely loved the first book, but didn't think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. 
 Too many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. Maybe it was because it's supposed to be a children's book, but I didn't like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God's #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. 
 On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children's book :) I did like the Dante's Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman's description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa's world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians. I'm usually not a tragedy fan, but I did think Lyra & Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending.",0,4,1,181,35.26,7.84,62.6,85.6,30.17,20.44,90.06,69.61,58.01,8.84,5.52,3.87,0.0,0.55,0.0,1.1,3.31,14.36,10.5,1.66,9.39,13.26,8.84,8.29,2.21,18.78,6.63,2.76,5.52,2.21,2.21,1.1,19.89,0.0,19.89,6.08,4.97,2.76,2.21,0.55,6.08,0.0,6.63,5.52,1.1,2.21,1.66,0.55,0.0,0.0,0.55,0.0,9.94,6.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.21,3.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.87,0.0,0.0,2.21,0.0,1.66,2.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.66,0.0,0.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1,0.55,4.97,4.42,0.55,0.0,3.31,0.0,0.0,0.55,3.31,7.73,3.31,2.21,1.1,0.55,0.55,0.0,0.0,20.44,3.31,4.97,0.0,0.0,6.08,6.08,0

"I found this book on a recommendation from a good friend, and if it wasn't for that I might have put it down right away, because the tone is very markety, and the author makes a lot of big claims with little substance. 
 That being said, the author must be a smart guy because there is a lot of good stuff in this book. 
 Big Takeaways 
 1. Most of us have the idea that we are supposed to work until we are 60, then retire and live the good life. Tim does a great job pointing out how backwards that idea is, and gives lots of suggestions for how to change your life to accommodate. He calls those who have done so the ""New Rich"", as they are rich in life - which is not related to being rich in dollars. 
 2. Take 'mini-retirements' throughout your life instead of planning to retire at the end of your life (which I probably wouldn't do anyways). This means every 5 years take a year off to go on a big adventure. Tim's point is you don't need to be rich to do this, and gives a lot of advice on how to go about it. I don't think he'll convince too many people, but it does sound like he's starting to have a following. 
 3. Be a business owner - not a business runner. One gives you lots of free time - the other consumes your life (which I can currently attest to :) 
 4. Time is your most valuable asset. Tim gives a lot of good tips for time management - which aren't unique, but every time you read them helps you. The ones that stuck out for me were: 
 - only check email 3 times a day at set intervals 
 - outsource everything you can to 3rd parties (like a virtual concierge in India who works for $5/hr) 
 - batch activities like paying bills for max efficiency 
 - give employees autonomous rules/guidelines 
 - avoid meetings whenever possible - use emails instead (works wonders) 
 5. Try to start businesses that can be completely outsourced after you've set them up, so they run on auto-pilot. The author did it with a nutrient company - I'm dubious on this one though. 
 6. 80/20 rule. 80% of your revenue probably comes from 20% of your customers. You can save a lot of time and make more money by focusing where it matters - on the 20%. This applies to most things in life, and although I've read it before it was a good refresher. 
 7. Reach out to important people. Don't be afraid to reach out to important/famous people for advice. They are often more accessible than you think. Tim had good tips for this - like always uses phone's and not emails. 
 8. Avoid excessive information: too much information input can overload you, so avoid reading news on subjects that don't relate to what you do. If something important happens in the world you will hear about it - or its good conversation when you meet with a friend (""whats new in the world?"")",76,5,1,511,52.15,62.13,37.99,86.38,15.97,14.48,92.95,71.23,58.32,14.68,7.83,1.57,0.59,3.72,0.59,0.98,6.85,14.68,6.26,3.91,15.66,10.37,5.28,5.48,1.96,17.61,6.07,8.02,3.91,0.98,1.37,1.76,13.7,0.78,12.92,3.13,1.96,2.35,2.15,0.59,4.11,0.0,5.68,5.09,0.59,1.76,1.57,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.52,3.91,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.35,7.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.78,6.26,0.59,0.0,3.72,2.74,0.0,0.39,0.2,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.39,10.76,6.65,0.78,1.37,5.09,0.0,0.39,0.0,4.11,2.15,7.83,1.17,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.96,6.07,2.54,0.2,0.0,3.13,8.02,0

"Ok I must admit first I only saw the movie, so not sure if the book has a lot more info or not. But I thought I'd review it all the same. Gore, like all skilled politicians, is clearly a very good communicator. I came into the documentary very wary, having heard rumors about alternative motives, political agendas, etc. It might still be true. My main criticism with it was the lack of scientific 'proof'. We saw a lot compelling graphs, but didn't hear their sources or meet respected scientists who back them. Gore clearly isn't a journalist. 
 But despite all that, Gore has given us a lot of good food for thought on a subject that *definitely* matters a lot. So kudos to him!

"I'm not sure if I love Khaled's characters (see my review of The Kite Runner), but the man can tell a story. I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way. 
 So a little sad, but I liked it. I think the thing I liked most was that I've read so few books about that area of the world, and now I feel like I've gotten to know it, just a tiny bit.",15,5,1,152,56.29,7.5,84.38,50.53,21.71,14.47,92.11,71.71,56.58,13.16,7.24,6.58,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.92,14.47,8.55,0.66,14.47,5.26,7.89,9.87,1.32,15.79,3.95,5.26,4.61,1.97,0.0,2.63,14.47,1.97,12.5,5.92,1.97,1.32,1.97,0.66,3.29,0.0,5.92,3.95,1.97,2.63,0.66,1.32,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,7.24,3.95,1.32,0.0,0.66,0.0,1.32,2.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,1.97,1.32,0.66,0.0,2.63,0.0,0.0,2.63,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.66,0.0,0.66,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,9.21,9.87,0.66,0.66,5.92,1.97,0.0,0.66,2.63,5.92,3.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.47,4.61,5.26,0.0,0.0,2.63,1.97,0

"This is the best self help book any entrepreneur could ever read. Perhaps the only one they need to. Truly transformative. I have it on audio too and listen to it at the gym often. 
 Napoleon Hill was tasked by Andrew Carnegie to write a book on what made a successful person succeed, and he spent 20 years researching and interviewing every great name of the day (Ford, Woolworth, Edison, etc), plus lots of people who failed (because you have to know what doesn't work too). This book is the result. 
 It basically hammers home a single point, over and over again. Success comes from knowing what you want to achieve and having a burning desire to achieve it.

"I really enjoyed this book. The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. 
 I think my favorite part of this book is the word 'grok'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is 'to be enlightened about something'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you're also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like 'grok' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn't forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was ""a Martian word""! 
 One thing that I grokked (yes I'm going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60's manifesto for free love. I wasn't alive in the 60's, but given everything I know about the 60's from movies, books, etc it seemed that my grokking was right.",48,5,1,240,24.09,54.96,71.5,95.23,21.82,14.17,92.08,72.08,59.58,22.5,12.5,5.83,0.83,3.75,1.25,0.42,10.0,16.67,6.25,2.08,12.08,8.33,5.0,7.08,1.25,15.42,5.0,2.92,4.17,1.67,2.08,1.25,17.92,1.25,16.67,5.0,1.67,0.83,4.58,1.67,4.58,0.0,6.25,5.83,0.0,2.92,2.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,15.42,5.83,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.83,3.33,10.0,0.0,0.42,0.83,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.25,0.0,2.5,0.83,0.42,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,7.08,7.08,1.25,0.42,5.0,0.83,0.42,0.0,2.5,6.25,4.17,1.25,0.83,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,16.25,4.17,2.08,0.0,0.42,5.42,4.17,0

"Recommended in Stanford Magazine and by Guy Kawasaki. 
 A very useful book about the growth mindset. Essentially, the book makes a case that those people who look at everything they do in life as a learning opportunity are much more successful. 
 I think where this comes into play most often is when we face a setback, or a failure. Whether thats getting rejected from something (a job, a team, etc), messing up at work, having your boss yell at you, losing at something, getting laid off, making a bad bet, etc - most of us have many setbacks in our lives. How we deal with those is incredibly important. If we let the setback define us, we might think we aren't talented after all, and lose confidence. If on the other hand, we look at it as something we can learn from, we improve as a person. 
 I came at the book as it was recommended to me as being good for parents. My daughter is only 1.6 years, but already she is learning fast. The book recommends praising our children's efforts, instead of their results. Telling them they are ""amazing"", and ""smart"" is so easy to do, but if you do that their whole lives they won't succeed when they get to the real world. What you want is to encourage a learning attitude. This quote sums it up: 
 ""So what should we say when children complete a task--say, math problems--quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I say, ""Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize for wasting your time. Let's do something you can really learn from!"" 
 Looking at life as a constant challenge is fun. And you can't fail at a personal challenge! Here is a great mental imagery technique the book mentioned when you are doing something you are bad at: 
 ""Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going."" 
 Another interesting bit was how people at the top of their game can get caught up in a fixed mindset. You see this in sports all the team - the champion team from last year thinks they can cruise through this year, doesn't work hard, and suddenly they are losing a lot. It's so hard to maintain the edge. John Wooden puts it best: 
 ""I believe ability can get you to the top,"" says coach John Wooden, ""but it takes character to keep you there.... It's so easy to ... begin thinking you can just 'turn it on' automatically, without proper preparation. It takes real character to keep working as hard or even harder once you're there. When you read about an athlete or team that wins over and over and over, remind yourself, 'More than ability, they have character.'""",29,4,1,471,27.04,96.34,41.85,93.74,14.72,18.26,94.27,76.22,59.02,18.26,11.89,1.7,3.18,3.82,0.21,2.76,6.37,13.8,6.79,0.42,12.74,9.34,7.43,8.28,0.85,20.17,7.22,3.18,11.68,4.88,5.73,1.27,13.8,0.85,12.74,3.18,1.06,2.12,3.18,1.06,3.61,0.21,8.07,6.79,1.27,1.27,0.85,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.26,5.73,1.7,0.21,0.21,0.21,1.91,12.74,0.85,0.0,0.42,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.67,1.27,0.0,3.18,0.21,0.0,1.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,1.91,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.85,0.64,0.21,8.07,8.92,0.42,1.91,5.1,1.27,0.21,0.64,3.82,1.7,7.86,0.85,0.21,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,22.08,7.22,6.16,0.42,0.42,2.76,5.1,0

"A very interesting and very French perspective on the Google Book Search project and digitization in general. Jeanneney basically makes the point that there are certain dangers for France and Europe since Google, which is an American company, has undertaken the monumental task of digitizing a great deal of the world's knowledge. His worry is that Google will prioritize in the digitization queue primarily books in english, as well books that are most pertinent to American culture. Now since human knowledge is little more than the sum of our written history, this unfair digitization has the potential in coming years to cause damage to cultures that aren't represented in it. 
 Jeanneney is (very wisely actually) trying to create an uproar around the issue in order to rally support in the EU around creating and funding a European digitization project. He even presents all the possibilities: 1. government funding 2. create their own search engine 3. do it open source wikipedia style. 
 I sympathize and even understand Jeanneney's perspective (although did I mention it was very French?:). But what was most interesting to me was that I realized how lucky I am to live in a country where Capitalism is at work. What Jeanneney is so desperate to accomplish in Europe has happened in America not magically or by chance, but because of incentive. In Freakonomics I think the author said something like ""economics is the study of incentives"". And Google is evidently has incentive to scan a whole lotta books. 
 One last thought. At the end Jeanneney finally gets to the interesting part, and wonders what to do with this cultural wealth of 1's and 0's once its been created. He says: ""Here again, the government, taking care not to stifle imagination or inhibit civic efforts, must be the driving force."" Talk about lack of incentive. I wonder who will be better at figuring out a good way to organize and search all the worlds data: Google, or the EU? My money is on Larry and Sergey all the way.",1,3,1,341,71.44,18.03,54.68,61.76,17.05,23.75,90.03,66.28,53.08,8.8,4.11,2.35,0.29,0.0,0.88,0.29,4.69,14.08,7.92,2.05,14.37,8.5,6.74,6.45,0.88,16.72,4.69,4.4,5.57,0.59,3.81,1.17,15.25,0.88,14.08,4.4,2.64,1.17,2.64,1.17,3.52,0.0,4.99,3.81,1.17,1.47,0.59,0.59,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.16,2.64,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.29,1.47,2.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,5.87,1.17,1.47,3.23,5.57,0.0,0.0,4.11,1.47,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.59,0.29,0.0,0.0,1.17,0.59,2.64,3.52,8.21,0.59,0.59,7.04,0.29,0.0,0.0,2.93,3.52,6.74,0.88,0.29,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.08,5.57,2.93,0.59,0.0,1.47,3.52,0

"Loved every second of this book. Each chapter is a different story of a startup founder. I read it slowly so it wouldn't end, and read many chapters twice. My biggest take was that most founders didn't necessarily know what they were doing - or even that they were on to something big. But they were all determined to start a company - that was the only thing they all had in common. 
 Here are some good quotes from the book: 
 ""I'd say determination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the founders I spoke with were superhuman in any way, it was in their perseverance."" 
 -- Jessica Livingston (the author) 
 ""I see way too many people give up in the startup world. They just give up too easily. Recruiting is a classic example. I don't even hear the first ""no"" that somebody says. When they say, ""No, I'm not interested"", I think ""Now it's a real challenge. Now's when the tough part begins."" It's hard to identify talent, but great people don't look for jobs, great people are sold on jobs. And if they're sold they're going to say no at first. You have to win them over."" 
 -- Joe Kraus (founder of Excite) 
 ""Ultimately, you cannot accomplish something completely on your own. You really need to develop a network of people who win when you win."" 
 -- Ray Ozzie (Founder of Groove Networks, Chief Architect of Microsoft) 
 ""My philosophy on these types of companies - consumer-based Internet companies - is that you don't need to worry about the business model initially. If you get users, then everything else follows. Basically any technology can be copied, any concept can be copied. In my opinion, what makes one of these companies valuable is the users. That can't be copied"" 
 -- Mark Fletcher (Founder of eGroups and Bloglines) 
 ""I am not a hunter, never have fired a gun, but I'm told that if you want to shoot a duck, you have to shoot where the duck is going to be, not where the duck is. It's the same with introducing technology: if you're only focused on the market today, by the time you introduce your solution to that problem, there'll probably be several others already entrenched."" 
 -- Charles Geschke (Founder of Adobe Systems) 
 ""The biggest thrill is frankly not the financial success, it's the ability to have an impact. Because we're both engineers at heart and that's every engineer's dream - to build something that millions of people will use."" 
 -- Charles Geschke (Founder of Adobe Systems) 
 ""Most programmers don't think about the user experience. They get a spec book, and they say, ""Well, I'm going to meet this spec to make the customer happy."" That's not really enough; you have to make something good for the user if you want to call yourself an engineer."" 
 -- Philip Greenspun (Founder of ArsDigita) 
 ""People don't like to write. It's hard. The people who were really good software engineers were usually great writers; they had tremendous ability to organize their thoughts and communicate. The people who were sort of average-quality programmers and had trouble thinking about the larger picture were the ones who couldn't write."" 
 -- Philip Greenspun (Founder of ArsDigita) 
 ""Things never work out right the first time. You've always got to do it two or three times to get it right. And things always go wrong. So persistence is the key to success. I had seen that in my career. I had seen that in computer design projects. I had seen that through my whole life. And so that word is the best single advice I can give to entrepreneurs. The key to success, if you had to sum it up in one, is persistence.""

"Sometimes you just need a quick fun book. I read this over Easter weekend, and loved every second. I loved the movie too, but the book was better. 
 This book really wasn't intellectual, but it did make one interesting point. In the book you can only vote if you have gone through and graduated from military training. This prevents the uneducated and uncommitted citizens from voting. While this is a bit extreme, I might be of the opinion that there should be some more barriers to voting (like a standardized test). Otherwise our elections end up being a marketing contest. Name recognition is huge in marketing - would W have won otherwise?

"I loved this book because it was a simple intro to buying real estate, much as The Wealthy Barber was a simple intro to personal finance. 
 I remember one of my favorite parts was where he examines the statement by many people that shows that the stock market has beaten the real estate annually in a historical comparison. Kiyosacki pointed out though that if you look at return on your money real estate wins hands down because you only have to put in 10% of your own money. So if you buy a 100K house with 10K, borrowing the 90K, and it appreciates to 105K after a year - you've got a 50% return.",3,4,1,113,74.28,70.83,59.67,62.01,28.25,14.16,94.69,64.6,53.98,14.16,8.85,2.65,0.0,5.31,0.88,0.0,5.31,18.58,9.73,6.19,14.16,5.31,4.42,7.96,0.0,9.73,7.08,3.54,3.54,0.0,0.88,2.65,11.5,0.0,11.5,2.65,1.77,0.0,1.77,0.0,4.42,0.88,4.42,3.54,0.88,1.77,1.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.5,4.42,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.77,7.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.39,0.0,0.88,7.96,10.62,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.77,0.0,2.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,7.08,9.73,3.54,2.65,5.31,0.88,0.0,0.0,2.65,6.19,1.77,1.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.73,3.54,2.65,0.0,0.0,0.88,2.65,0

"I first read this after college when my father gave it to me as a graduation gift. I almost didn't read it, but was very glad I did as it was very impactful on me, and I think helped shape me into the person I am today. I recently decided to re-read it after a meditation teacher was talking about it - and was glad to discover that it's just as relevant to my life now as it was before. It's a book I can easily see myself re-reading every 5-10 years. 
 The book is a story about how to be mindful and live a happy, aware life - coached in the story of young Berkeley gymnast who meets an old man - who he names Socrates - at a gas station. Socrates becomes his coach and mentor - and teaches him that his goals in life were all wrong. 
 If there is a motto of the book it's this quote, which I've had on my wall since I first read this book: 
 ""There are no ordinary moments!"" 
 The way of the peaceful warrior is to appreciate every moment, regardless of how dull or ordinary it may seem. To live in the now. Once you become aware of this, it's kind of amazing how much of our time we don't spend in the current moment - instead worrying about the past or the future. Our minds are swimming with the thoughts and worries of our lives, and we lack the easy ability to just be present. As Socrates said: 
 My mind is like a pond without ripples. Your mind is full of waves because you feel separated from, and often threatened by, an unplanned, unwelcome occurrence. Your mind is like a pond into which someone has just dropped a boulder!"" 
 The best way to live in the present moment is to learn to meditate. Meditation teaches you to become aware when the mind wanders, and that awareness is a muscle that like all muscles, needs constant exercise or it becomes diminished. What I liked about the book was it discusses where meditation can go - and how one can be meditating constantly. In fact, it's not really meditation, but the art of focusing the mind that feels so good and fulfilling to us. This is why sports are so great - you are forced to focus your mind 100% on what you are doing, and distracting thoughts fade to the background. That ability to focus is calming, and appealing. I like how the book explains that using gymnastics. 
 ""Silence is the warrior's art -- and meditation is his sword. With it, you'll cut through your illusions. But understand this: the sword's usefulness depends upon the swordsman. If you don't know how to use the weapon properly, it can become a dangerous, deluding, or useless tool. Meditation can initially help you to relax. You may put your 'sword' on display, proudly show it to friends. The gleam of this sword distracts many meditators until they abandon it to seek other esoteric techniques."" 
 But I liked how the book goes much deeper than meditation. There were cool bits about breathing properly, monitoring your internal organs, massage, having the mindset of a child, and eating healthily. 
 ""The pleasure from eating, Dan, is more than the taste of the food and the feeling of a full belly. Learn to enjoy the entire process -- the hunger beforehand, the careful preparation, setting an attractive table, chewing, breathing, smelling, tasting, swallowing, and the feeling of lightness and energy after the meal. You can even enjoy the full and easy elimination of the food after it's digested. When you pay attention to all elements of the process, you'll begin to appreciate simple meals.""

"I haven't read a good spy novel in a while - and this was a great one. Truly well written, and an amazing story given how short the book is. I tore through it in one day! 
 It really dove into what it's like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what's best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time ""coming in from the cold"" - as did Laemas. 
 The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That's impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. 
 The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas' love interest)'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.",3,5,1,287,74.16,54.61,47.46,79.13,19.13,10.45,90.24,72.47,58.54,11.5,5.23,1.05,0.0,0.7,3.14,0.0,6.27,16.38,9.06,1.39,16.72,9.41,5.92,6.27,0.7,18.47,4.88,4.88,2.79,0.35,0.7,1.74,9.41,1.74,7.67,1.39,1.05,0.7,1.74,0.7,2.09,0.0,6.62,5.23,1.39,1.74,1.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.45,4.53,0.0,0.0,0.7,0.7,1.39,5.57,0.0,0.35,0.0,3.14,0.7,0.0,0.35,0.35,3.14,1.74,0.35,1.05,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.7,1.39,0.35,1.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.7,10.45,13.59,0.0,2.44,11.15,0.35,0.0,0.7,3.48,8.71,3.14,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,14.29,4.88,3.48,0.0,0.35,2.09,3.48,0

"** spoiler alert ** 
 This book may as well have been called One Hundred Years of Inbreeding And Human Drama. It was basically a story about a small town where the gene pool is so small that everyone marries their relations, and it seems like life spirals more and more downward and out of control over 100 years. I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one's quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending. 
 I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist. Melquiades's scrolls, the floating priest, etc. According to Wikipedia this is called ""magical realism"".

"This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories. 
 One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) 
 I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. 
 Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. 
 I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.",77,5,1,322,58.67,60.38,27.99,84.9,17.89,23.29,86.02,69.57,56.52,14.29,10.25,2.48,0.31,1.55,4.97,0.93,4.04,14.91,6.83,0.31,14.29,8.7,4.66,5.28,1.86,15.84,7.14,3.11,1.86,0.62,0.62,0.93,17.08,1.86,15.22,6.52,2.48,1.86,1.24,0.93,3.11,0.0,4.35,4.35,0.0,1.86,1.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.11,2.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,1.24,9.01,0.0,0.0,0.31,4.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.52,1.86,0.0,4.04,0.62,0.0,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.31,0.31,1.86,4.97,7.45,0.0,0.93,5.59,0.93,0.0,0.0,3.11,7.45,2.17,0.0,0.31,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.04,5.28,2.17,0.0,0.31,0.31,4.97,0
"Almost every surfer I know has recommended this, so I finally read it. I've never really found a surf book I liked, but this was closest. I'm not sure if the author and I would have been surf buddies (he's 50, a longboarder, picks fights, and used to run drugs), but he's definitely a great story-teller. And his adventures traveling from Mexico to Costa Rica are a trip. He does a great job weaving in stories from his younger days, stories of his pot smuggling days, and stories of his journey to make a very good beach read. I loved hearing the stories of all the people he meets - half the expats down south are 'on the run' - and have great stories :) 
 Aside from the good storytelling I felt there was depressing undertone to the book, as if the author was never quite satisfied with his life regardless of what happened to him. This makes sense I suppose given he's kinda having a midlife crisis - but it didn't amp me up with enthusiasm for life. But on the positive side, it did gave me a strong thirst to explore central america soon - and to go surfing :)",0,4,1,198,43.59,12.22,57.71,93.93,24.75,16.67,90.4,72.73,55.05,14.65,11.11,5.56,0.0,0.0,5.56,0.0,3.54,13.64,8.59,0.51,11.62,9.6,5.56,7.07,2.02,19.7,4.55,2.53,1.01,0.51,0.0,0.51,14.65,2.02,12.63,2.53,1.52,0.51,4.04,1.01,4.55,0.0,8.59,7.07,1.52,3.54,3.03,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,12.63,5.56,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,2.53,6.06,0.0,0.51,0.0,5.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.54,2.02,0.0,1.52,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.51,0.51,0.0,0.51,0.51,1.01,7.07,10.1,0.0,4.04,5.05,0.0,0.51,1.01,3.54,7.58,5.56,0.51,1.52,1.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.18,3.54,5.05,0.0,0.0,4.04,5.56,0

"The second volume of the masterful Sherlock Holmes. The first was probably better, but this was a very good read as well. I have all the respect for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he really makes you believe in Holmes' genius. 
 One interesting tidbit is that he killed Holmes off at the end of the last book, because he thought he was ""obscuring my higher work"". Ironic since none of his other work has any popularity. Due to popular demand, Holmes returned 20 years later. 
 A great quote: 
 ""I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uese of dogs in the work of the detective ... A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.""

"Most stuff in this book I already knew (90%). But hearing it in a cohesive story is a great way to fodder new ideas - if you wanna think about the internet and where its going, its a great primer - and a quick read too. 
 Hearing the the Goto/Overture story was interesting. While it sounds obvious, its an impressive insight by Bill Gross that traffic with an intent (ie search traffic) is worth more than random traffic, and that if you played arbitrage in the middle you could make a lot of money. I like it when people can do math :)

"I read this in high school, and it was one of my favorite's at the time. I just re-read it as the movie is out, and was glad to see it's still one of my favorites. Ender is pretty much just badass. The military strategy and leadership is actually one of my favorite things about this book. 
 The notion that Ender was set apart from the other kids as an intentional tactic to make him into a leader was always fascinating to me. In many ways I can relate to it. Ender's story is one of leadership, and leaders often have to balance empathy with big picture priorities. His older brother was too harsh and lacked empathy - but Ender is the perfect balance. 
 One of the key ways Ender keeps winning is by being aggressive and proactive, rather than reactive. Both with the bullies, in war games, and with the buggers, he takes them out before they have the chance to take him out: 
 ""Knocking him down won the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones, too. So they'd leave me alone."" 
 ""When it comes down to it, though, the real decision is inevitable: If one of us has to be destroyed, let's make damn sure we're the ones alive at the end. Our genes won't let us decide any other way. Nature can't evolve a species that hasn't a will to survive. Individuals might be bred to sacrifice themselves, but the race as a whole can never decide to cease to exist. So if we can we'll kill every last one of the buggers, and if they can they'll kill every last one of us."" 
 I didn't fully understand the point of the plot line about Enders brother and sister becoming net celebrities. I mean it was cool, but this cartoon summarizes it well: http://xkcd.com/635/ 
 What I like about this book is that Ender is pushed to his limits to improve himself, which shows a raw side of humanity. It makes you think. Here is a quote which I think encapsulates that well:

"My old CEO and mentor (James Currier) gave me this book for christmas after I first started work at his company. He said they handed it out at HBS and it was a simple but very powerful intro to managing your finances. And it was. So forget Personal Finance For Dummies (which I also read) - start with this. 
 Personal finance is something that isn't taught in school, but is incredibly important - and the basics aren't very hard. I found this book invaluable as a young software engineer, when I was making a salary and didn't know how to invest it, and I would recommend it for anyone in their 20's.

"About fads: ""language is such technology"" 
 This book is a fascinating look into early 90's software culture. When Microsoft and Bill ruled the world, and silicon valley was just gaining momentum. 
 Its amazing the changes the ""information superhighway"" brought us! I think Social Networking is born from the lack of geeks (those who make software) having a life in the 90's. These geeks, bogged down in technology (internet, cell phones, email, dvd's, movies, tv shows), found a way to socialize within the parameters of the technology. Then it caught on with others.

"Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think. 
 three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. 
 Law of the Few (people who influence): 
 - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. 
 - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. 
 - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. 
 Stickyness Factor 
 - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show 
 was good. 
 - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. 
 - make the message personal to make it memorable 
 The Power of Context 
 - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. 
 - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. 
 - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. 
 - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.",95,4,1,331,90.72,63.31,22.17,76.48,14.39,21.45,83.08,58.01,44.11,8.46,3.63,0.0,0.3,0.6,0.6,1.21,4.83,13.9,7.85,2.11,14.2,5.14,2.42,4.23,0.91,13.9,5.74,5.44,4.83,0.6,1.51,2.72,13.9,0.0,13.29,3.93,3.93,0.6,1.21,0.6,3.63,0.6,6.95,5.14,1.51,2.72,2.11,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,11.78,4.23,0.0,0.3,0.0,0.0,1.51,7.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.91,0.91,0.6,0.0,0.3,4.53,0.6,0.3,3.02,0.91,0.0,0.6,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,0.3,7.25,6.95,0.91,0.3,3.02,1.81,0.6,0.3,4.23,6.34,1.51,0.6,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.45,6.95,2.11,0.0,0.0,1.81,10.57,0

"Interesting Tidbits 
 - Three forces need to create the long tail: 
 1. democratize production: give average people the ability to create quality content (movies, music, blogs) 
 2. democratize distribution: technology to aggregate *all* the content in a genre (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes) 
 3. Connect Supply and Demand: filters to help people find the niche's they are interested in (Google, recommendations, best-seller lists) 
 - One quarter of Amazon's sales come from books outside its top 100,000 titles. Thus having a long tail adds ~33% to your bottom line. 
 - Ranking bestsellers across niche's genre's gives little value. Filters to rank items must be applied within each niche to become relevant. Goodreads could improve here. 
 - As the number of niche's increases, the ability of people to consume more content within the genre increases. This depends on the genre, but it gives me hope that we can increase the number of people who read through Goodreads, by creating better filters to connect readers of various niche's. 
 - each year 200,000 books are published in english, and fewer than 20,000 make it into a bookstore. Only 2% of the books published in 2004 sold more than 5000 copies, and can be considered profitable. 
 - There is another factor that determines why people create content, other than money: reputation. 
 - Ebay has 60 million active users",15,5,1,214,94.21,34.73,13.92,71.56,15.29,25.23,80.84,57.01,40.65,5.61,2.34,0.47,0.47,0.47,0.0,0.47,3.27,13.55,6.07,6.54,14.95,5.14,2.34,3.74,0.0,14.02,6.54,10.28,6.54,0.93,4.21,1.87,12.15,0.47,11.21,2.34,1.87,3.27,0.93,0.93,3.27,0.0,3.27,3.27,0.0,0.47,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.21,1.4,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.8,0.93,0.0,1.87,6.54,1.87,0.0,3.74,1.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.47,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.0,2.8,7.48,10.28,0.47,0.47,8.88,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.93,5.61,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27.1,6.07,7.01,0.0,0.0,2.8,11.21,0

"A must read - really interesting stories about how people process things unconsciously. 
 - for instance, you can't hide your feeling about race from your unconscious - take the Race Test (http://www.understandingprejudice.org...). It said I (and 13% of test-takers) have a 'moderate automatic preference for European American compared to African American'.

"** spoiler alert ** 
 So the other day Elizabeth and I are in the book store and she saw this book, and said she really wanted me to read it. In horror at the thought of reading what I thought was a 'chick book', i immediately countered that she would then have to read one of my favorites: Dune. She agreed! 
 So I read it, and I have to admit, it was good - damn good. Even though there was a serious lack of any gratuitous violence, I tore through it in several days. Austen is an amazing writer, and has a particular talent for explaining her characters deep motivations (or prejudices) in a few defining sentences. 
 I think my favorite part of it is the unwinding of Elizabeths' prejudices against Mr Darcy. It is done so slowly and artfully and believably that the reader is completely pulled into the story. 
 It is a definite period piece - here are a few funny observations: 
 - Nobody in the book had a job - they all earned income from their estates 
 - Since nobody had jobs they spent all day gossiping 
 - People were judged not by what they did for a living but what family they were from and how they behaved in society. Completely different from today! 
 - Dating was much tougher back then. You needed at least 10 dates to get anywhere, and you probably had to marry in order to go all the way. 
 Jokes aside, this is a classic, and I highly recommend it for any guy or girl.",155,5,1,254,37.2,33.38,58.41,50.44,19.54,16.54,92.13,74.41,61.42,16.14,9.45,4.33,0.0,0.79,1.97,2.36,6.69,14.96,7.09,0.79,12.2,9.06,5.91,7.87,1.18,17.72,5.12,5.51,2.36,0.79,0.79,0.79,14.57,1.97,12.6,3.15,1.18,1.57,2.36,1.97,3.94,0.0,3.94,2.76,0.79,1.97,1.57,0.39,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.39,12.6,5.51,0.0,0.39,0.0,1.18,1.18,7.87,0.39,0.0,2.76,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.72,0.39,0.0,3.54,1.18,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.76,0.39,0.79,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.39,0.79,4.72,7.87,0.39,1.18,6.3,0.39,0.0,0.0,3.94,7.87,3.54,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.75,4.33,3.54,0.0,0.79,1.18,5.91,0
"Just re-read this for the first time, and it's still one of my favorites. This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. 
 It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. 
 I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). 
 The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! 
 If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.",2,5,1,268,24.3,19.23,59.19,25.02,22.33,18.28,85.82,69.4,57.46,14.18,6.34,2.61,1.49,0.0,0.75,1.12,7.84,15.67,5.97,2.24,11.19,9.7,7.84,8.58,2.61,14.18,7.84,7.46,5.97,1.87,2.24,1.87,13.43,1.12,12.31,3.73,0.75,0.37,2.99,0.37,4.48,0.75,4.85,2.61,2.24,1.49,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.72,2.61,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,1.49,4.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.12,2.99,0.0,0.75,2.24,2.99,0.0,0.0,2.99,0.0,0.0,1.49,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37,1.49,0.37,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.37,3.36,5.22,0.37,0.75,3.73,0.0,0.0,0.37,5.22,3.73,6.72,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.66,4.1,6.34,0.0,0.37,2.61,5.22,0

"When people ask me what my favorite book is, Dune is always my answer. Words cannot even do justice to what an epic tale this is. We learn about spirituality, human nature, politics, religion, and the making of a hero. 
 I loved the spiritual aspects of the book the best. The philosophies and practices and Pranu Bindu training of the Bene Gesserit that Paul learns and builds upon. The Bene Gesserit believe in a training regiment that results in a superior human being - one with every sense as refined as possible. This means a focus on learning, on controlling emotion, on controlling your body. 
 My absolute favorite quote from Dune is the Bene Gesserit litany against fear: 
 ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."" 
 The litany is meant to be recited when you are in a moment of fear, and as I first read Dune 20 years ago, I've employed it many times. After Paul employs it when he is fighting Jamis, the affect on him is described as ""a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready."" I have read a lot about people who perform at high levels - whether it be in athletics or business, and success is all about getting into that zen state where you have a clear, focused mind. Fear is the biggest thing that can cloud one's mind - usually fear of failure, but there are other forms too. While this Litany won't always eliminate it, I've felt it to be useful to recognize the fear and call it out for what it is. 
 There is also a focus in the book on being able to read people by paying attention to the minutia. In many crucial scenes we see Paul and Jessica and others employing this skill, using not only their eyes, but reading the tone of what a person says, what their body language or actions say, and more. Imagine the poker player I could be if I learned these skills! 
 ""If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken."" 
 It's interesting to me that so many science fiction novels contemplate a future with AI (aka post-singularity). In Dune, the Butlerian Jihad was the human rebellion to rid itself of AI or ""thinking machines"". They are now banned, and in their place we have Mentats, who are humans with processing powers far greater than any thinking machine. It's unclear to the software engineer in me how exactly that could be without some sort of physical manipulation (insertion of massive amounts of transistors, for instance), but the affect is pretty cool, we get Spock-esque beings who analyze everything extremely logically, and are great at political planning ""feints within feints within feints"". 
 There was a lot in the book about leadership. It started with Paul first learning about it from his Father, and also from the Bene Gesserit. This quote stood out to me: 
 ""She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,"" Paul said. ""And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do."" She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue. ""She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men."" 
 Later as he grows into a leader himself, Paul learns that the most essential ingredient to be a leader is to lead people to a worthy goal. 
 ""It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul's place for him."" 
 Much has been made in modern reviews of Dune of the fact that it's clearly a statement about oil and the Middle East. The book even admits the Fremen are of Sunni descent, and many words they use (Jinn, Jihad, etc) are Arabic. I'm not sure I understand all the undertones, but one thing that was clear was about control of the worlds most precious commodity: ""The people who can destroy a thing, they control it."" I hope we are closing in on the end of the days when oil controls so much, but we aren't there yet. In the meantime, we had best beware of any future Harkonnen's.",68,5,1,788,51.34,45.32,41.1,32.56,16.77,16.24,88.83,70.18,57.49,15.23,9.01,3.55,0.89,0.76,2.28,1.02,6.22,15.48,7.87,0.76,13.2,9.26,5.33,6.35,1.02,16.62,7.36,3.81,5.96,1.02,1.78,3.3,13.71,0.76,12.94,3.93,2.28,1.65,2.41,0.38,3.17,0.0,5.2,2.92,2.03,1.78,0.25,1.27,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.68,4.82,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.51,2.03,6.98,0.25,0.0,1.02,1.65,1.4,0.51,0.25,0.63,4.06,0.38,0.0,2.66,0.25,0.89,1.9,0.76,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13,0.0,1.02,0.13,0.25,0.0,0.13,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.76,4.19,8.5,0.51,1.02,5.71,0.63,0.0,0.89,3.43,3.81,5.46,1.14,0.13,0.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.88,5.84,4.82,0.0,0.13,1.4,4.7,0

"This book is, so many times over, a true story. Culleton does not hold back in her descriptions of the horrors these women faced. However, from true stories I've heard, it is not even close to as horrible as it gets. The way native people have been treated in this country (and elsewhere) is shameful. The trickledown effect of residential schooling and prejudice has scarred our history (and is sadly, still perpetuated) and so many seem unaware. Those that say this book has an agenda... well, it certainly should. 
 The author, in my opinion, successfully wrote on the issue of generational pain without making it seem as though she was ""making excuses"" (a common complaint I hear from prejudice types). The two little girls grew up in an unstable home, had their lives torn apart, and faced hardships throughout their lives. I particularly identified with Cheryl who tried desperately to turn her pain into positive action and struggled so deeply. 
 The other themes she explores include cultural identity, skin colour, addiction, family... She also explores the question of personal strength which I think is something universal. 
 The style of the writing is not the type that usually draws me in, but the story itself needs to be heard. It felt, to me, like April's real voice. Some might say it's too ""simplistic"" but I don't think every fictional book needs to sound like poetry to resonate.",0,4,1,236,43.72,18.69,68.42,1.14,15.73,21.19,89.41,71.19,54.66,13.98,7.2,3.39,0.42,0.0,2.12,0.85,6.78,14.83,6.78,0.42,12.71,8.05,7.2,7.2,1.69,18.64,6.78,2.54,2.12,0.42,0.85,0.85,16.53,0.42,16.1,5.08,1.69,1.27,2.54,2.12,4.66,0.0,5.93,1.27,4.66,2.54,0.0,2.54,0.42,0.0,0.42,0.0,11.86,5.93,0.0,0.0,0.42,1.69,4.24,5.08,0.0,0.0,2.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.97,0.42,0.85,1.69,0.0,0.0,2.54,1.27,0.85,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.27,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.85,0.85,4.66,13.14,0.42,1.69,7.63,0.42,1.69,1.27,1.69,5.08,7.2,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.76,8.05,6.78,0.0,0.0,1.69,4.24,0
"This is foremost, a book about people. Taylor begins as a somewhat naive young woman who has dreams bigger than her reality. Reading through Taylor's perspective made me feel nostalgic for my younger years where there seemed to be so many possibilities. I really love how the author explores common character types without bordering too much on stereotyping; these are real people we have probably all met at least once. 
 I've read that some felt Taylor was too changeable. I want to humbly point out that many girls her age... are. In that in-between stage from adolescence to true adulthood, I think it's easy to struggle to find your voice. But the progression in her thinking felt very believable to me. 
 I think it's important to understand Kingsolver's style. She has a way of seamlessly interweaving fantasy elements into stories that make you feel almost like you're hearing a story by word of mouth (how many people spin tales when they tell a story that happened to a ""friend of a friend""). That to me creates a sense of intimacy with the story and characters. 
 At first, I was expecting an entirely realistic tale and kept asking ""why didn't Taylor call the police? why didn't she report the abuse?"" But. That wouldn't make a very good story, now would it? ;) To be fair, I agree with some reviews that say this combination of VERY intense themes (child abuse, immigration, racism, etc) with unrealistic elements/heartwarming emotions can be a bit disarming. I felt a little unsettled reading of Turtle's abuse and the rest of the book didn't have such an intense tone, but I feel that is realistic. Often, horrific things happen, and life just goes on. But keeping an open mind, I do think this was a good book, to put it simply. I was rooting for Taylor and of course, for Turtle.",0,4,1,315,53.05,23.28,49.82,24.27,15.0,18.41,88.25,71.11,54.29,13.97,8.25,4.76,0.32,0.95,1.59,0.32,5.71,16.19,6.98,0.63,13.02,8.25,7.94,4.13,1.27,18.73,6.98,5.4,2.54,0.32,0.32,1.9,17.78,0.32,17.14,6.35,2.22,1.27,2.22,1.9,3.17,0.32,6.67,3.17,2.86,2.54,1.27,0.63,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.48,5.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63,3.81,4.76,0.0,0.0,2.22,0.32,0.63,0.32,0.32,0.0,1.9,0.32,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.27,6.98,6.98,0.63,1.27,2.22,0.0,0.32,2.22,3.17,5.4,5.4,0.32,0.63,0.32,0.32,0.0,0.0,19.37,6.35,4.44,0.95,0.0,3.49,4.13,0

"My heart goes out to Georgia for what she experienced with the loss of her child, but this was just not well written at all. It came off as a whiny, self absorbed child ranting in a journal. In serious need of editing, to say the least. I feel like her whiny demeanour could do more harm than good in trying to gain compassion for those who have struggled. 
 She is very defensive of herself and makes a lot of excuses for smoking and getting pregnant in a less than healthy situation to bring an infant into. 
 Her childhood was certainly difficult but she talks about it like she has the worst life in the world. Of course pain is not measurable, but I feel like this girl is making a lot of excuses for her own lack of self control. While insensitive and his motives questionable, there are certainly worse villains than her step-father. I'm glad that it does not seem that he acted on his perverted intentions, if he did have them.

"I always feel badly leaving a poor rating because I know how much work (and often passion and bits of your soul) goes into writing. But I would not be honest if I said I enjoyed this read. To be even more honest, I did not finish it and merely skimmed. 
 I love anything that incorporates Shakespeare and that was clever, but the main issue that turned me off is the 12 Step focus. I feel like it was almost an advertisement for the 12 Step programs. Perhaps someone who has been through one may feel differently about it though. I felt as though it took away from the story and from the main character herself.

"It is very hard to believe this is all true, but I'll take the author's word for it! 
 I've always had an open mind toward women who choose to work in this trade and a lot of compassion. I feel that often there is desperation in making the choice to sell your body, as shown by this story. 
 I feel like the story at times aimed to be ""sexy"" rather than ""sexual"", if that makes sense. I feel that took away from the biographical focus and edged on erotica.

"Ehhhhhh. 
 Really nothing to rave about. It was not poorly written in terms of style or technical aspects. The story was not particularly interesting and I feel it is a bit overdone.

"I enjoyed this book! There were some editing errors, as mentioned by other reviewers, but I don't feel that is a reason to completely toss a book. It was a free download but I feel it is worth keeping an eye out for future works.

 I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler, but... This is one of many books lately I've found that includes mistreatment of children and I certainly haven't been seeking that plot line out!

"A little predictable but it was a very gripping read. It caused my stomach to turn and my heart to race at moments, so I feel that means it's a successful story! I feel that it was not extremely realistic in some facets such as a man being allowed to just take in a child from the streets without mention of social services involvement and people just accepting this. 
 This is something I've noticed lately about the mystery/fiction genre that applies to this book. Sometimes too much disturbing detail was offered. I find the subject of child abuse needs to be handled sensitively. Tragically, this is something that occurs far too commonly in ""real life"". The average person is not educated on how to handle the details of such a tragic occurrence (as someone involved in social work or police work may be, for example) and I feel it could be upsetting to many readers, even those who may have experienced it.

"The story begins with a young boy and his friends witnessing a tragic accident - or so it seems. There is a very high chance that this boy and his friends may have caused it by a childish mistake. A magician is wrongfully imprisoned for the death of his partner and vows to take revenge on the children who were truly to blame. 
 Fast forward to the present time. The children have grown and gone on with their lives. The story that unfolds seeks to shed light on what truly happened as well as what happens when the magician begins to hunt them down. 
 I struggled to finish the story. It was not that the story wasn't well written, but I found myself not caring so much what happened.

But I feel... and I'm not sure how else to word this... but the character Mae was two-dimensional, almost an idealized version of a woman created by the author instead of a real person. Her actions did not seem fitting to her childhood. I feel like the abuse was portrayed almost in a stereotypical way to invoke emotions but fell short.

"Keeping in mind I'm someone who has watched movies such as Martyrs and can watch/read crime scene details while keeping a straight head... 
 This book was far too disturbing. Basically it felt like the authors wrote these stories merely for shock value. It included things like graphic cannibalism, sexually gratifying murder, pedophila, and extreme perversion all around. Particularly the stories by ""B.C Lawson"" disturbed me and made me wonder if he is actually a perverted serial killer. And who wants their work of fiction to create that worry... 
 There were a few stories that stood out from the rest as actually quite well-written. As it's a collection, I can't paint all authors included with the same brush. But I feel it's almost unfortunate for those few authors who have talent and didn't just spew out filth to be included with the rest.",0,2,1,144,37.3,18.97,15.38,4.22,16.0,23.61,86.11,70.83,55.56,14.58,6.94,3.47,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.69,7.64,13.89,6.25,0.0,12.5,8.33,7.64,7.64,1.39,20.14,4.86,2.78,2.08,0.0,1.39,0.69,15.28,1.39,13.89,2.08,0.69,2.08,3.47,2.08,3.47,0.0,10.42,4.17,6.25,1.39,0.69,0.69,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.72,5.56,0.0,0.0,1.39,1.39,2.78,4.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.08,0.69,0.0,1.39,0.0,0.0,4.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.39,0.0,2.78,0.0,0.69,0.69,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.39,4.86,9.03,1.39,0.0,5.56,2.08,0.0,1.39,0.69,7.64,6.94,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.75,9.72,2.78,0.0,0.0,3.47,2.78,0
"I have to be honest, not a fan of this book. It was not that the writing was poor, but it really did feel like a ploy to force religion down my throat.

"*Update - 10/27/13* - After some sleep, I thinking about Allegiant overall without the influence of other reviews, I changed my rating to a 2 which is deserved. 
 I know that no author is going to please the masses. I had given the first 2 books 5 stars. My ratings were well deserved. Allegiant was written with very little action, jumping on the train one time, which we learn later in the book it is controlled by people in the city and slows down. Blowing up a hole in a wall is not the action a reader wanted, we wanted to see Divergent action. 
 I cried with the ending and hoped that the book would have ended differently. No author can keep all the characters. Different plots and bland characters bent on power or revenge make up this book. 
 Sometimes authors produce gold and fail to live up the standards of their readers. Veronica spun gold twice and couldn't do it for a third time. 
 10/27/13 Review 
 I really wanted to give the book 2 stars but I chose 3 as it did get interesting around chapter 40, but it also felt really drawn out. Allegiant was nothing like Divergent and Insurgent. I read both Divergent and Insurgent 2x. I struggled getting through with Allegiant. For me, I didn't have much of a stronghold to keep reading. A lot of other readers, myself included, felt the first 2 books could have finished the series. I felt a few times that Veronica was grasping on a ending. I still don't see why the book took 18 months to be published. The mix of chapters from Tris to Four was confusing. Four didn't seem to have his character personality as he did in the prior books. Gone Girl did the character transitions from chapter to chapter much smoother. Several times I found myself wondering who's prospective I was reading from. Not to give anything away, read the book if you want to see how the series ends. Don't read the book if you want a complete spin off of the first 2 books and being placed in a Maze Runner setting.",0,2,1,361,76.74,5.65,66.7,23.74,14.44,17.73,88.37,69.53,54.02,10.53,7.48,5.26,0.55,0.55,0.55,0.28,3.05,16.9,9.14,6.65,13.85,8.31,3.6,4.71,2.77,21.05,3.6,6.93,2.77,0.55,0.55,1.66,16.07,1.11,14.68,3.6,1.66,3.32,2.49,0.55,4.43,0.0,2.49,1.39,1.11,1.11,0.28,0.83,0.0,0.28,0.28,0.0,5.54,2.77,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.55,0.55,2.49,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.55,0.55,0.55,0.0,0.0,4.16,0.0,0.0,4.16,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.66,0.83,0.55,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.55,6.37,9.14,0.0,2.22,4.71,0.83,0.0,1.39,4.16,9.42,3.05,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.57,6.93,2.77,0.0,0.0,1.66,2.22,0
"** spoiler alert ** 
 So many people have said you will laugh and cry reading this book and that's exactly what I did. The Edge of Never did start off slow but give it sometime, the story gets better and better. The last 50 pages you will need tissues. 
 I can't wait to see the 2nd book in Andrews POV. 
 I cried and cried after I read Andrew's letter to Camryn. The letter was moving and how he could never tell her about how much he loved her. If you don't want to know what the letter says, don't read any further. 
 ************************************* 
 Andrew's Letter 
 Dear Camryn, 
 I never wanted it to be this way. I wanted to tell you these things myself, but I was afraid. I was afraid that if I told you out loud that I love you, that what we had together would die with me. The truth is that I knew in Kansas that you were the one. I've loved you since that day when I first looked up into your eyes as you glared down at me from over the top of that bus seat. Maybe I didn't know it then, but I knew something had happened to me in that moment and I could never let you go. 
 I have never lived the way I lived during my short time with you. For the first time in my life, I've felt whole, alive, free. You were the missing piece of my soul, the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins. I think that if past lives are real then we have been lovers in ever single one of them. I've known you for a short time, but I feel like I've known you forever. 
 I want you to know that even in death I'' always remember you. I'll always love you. I wish that things could've turned out differently. I thought of you many nights on the road. I stared up at the ceiling in the motels and pictured what our life might be like together if I have lived. I even got all mushy and thought of you in a wedding dress and even with a mini me in your belly. You know, I always heard that sex is great when you're pregnant. ;-) 
 But I'm sorry that I had to leave you, Camryn. I'm so sorry...I wish the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was real because then you could come to the Underworld and sing me back into your life. I wouldn't look back. I wouldn't fuck it up like Orpheus did. 
 I'm so sorry, baby... 
 I want you to promise me that you'll stay strong and beautiful and sweet and caring. I want you to be happy and find someone who will love you as much as I did. I want you to get married and have babies and live your life. Just remember to always be yourself and don't be afraid to speak your mind or to dream out loud. 
 I hope you'll never forget me. 
 One more thing: don't feel bad for not telling me that you loved me. You didn't need to say it. I knew all along that you did. 
 Love Always,

"After reading I finished I Capture the Castle, Nancy Mitford was recommended as an author who wrote magically romantic stories. I was so disappointed by this book, especially after finding out that Mitford was buddies with one of my all time favorites, Evelyn Waugh. That connection, and the recommendation off of I Capture the Castle, had me expecting something more than the stale, perfunctory writing of this by the numbers account of a piece of cardboard of a character. It's a basic, flat account of an uninteresting story. It also takes WAY too long to realize who the story is actually about.

"The unsolved murder of William Desmond Taylor is one of the most fascinating stories from Hollywood's history. Unfortunately, A Cast of Killers does it little justice. It's easily the worst of the books I've read about the murder. It's very sloppy. Photos are mismarked, the research is poor. It reads more like a sensationalized version of events from a trashy gossip magazine.

"*Minor spoilers* 
 Okay... Listen... I love this series a LOT. But... This book felt... Incomplete? Kinda? It was very predictable, and I know romance stories are GENERALLY predictable but this one felt... More so. And it felt... Very very surface. I don't know how to describe it but none of the characters really felt like they developed, and nothing was dove into that deeply. She just fell in love with him like that? She can just decide all that at the end like that? What? It felt like nothing was developed and everything was just throw out there like ""sure"" 
 I don't know. It just felt like decisions were made randomly and out of the blue and never truly developed",0,3,1,120,7.21,8.37,74.02,59.44,7.06,15.0,95.0,83.33,66.67,19.17,6.67,3.33,0.0,0.0,2.5,0.83,12.5,13.33,3.33,0.83,12.5,7.5,11.67,8.33,5.0,19.17,4.17,5.0,0.83,0.83,0.0,0.0,25.0,5.0,20.0,10.0,1.67,0.83,2.5,1.67,2.5,0.0,2.5,2.5,0.0,1.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.5,4.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.67,3.33,0.0,0.0,1.67,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.5,13.33,0.83,1.67,5.83,0.83,0.83,5.0,1.67,10.83,3.33,1.67,1.67,0.83,0.83,0.0,0.0,30.0,19.17,1.67,4.17,0.0,1.67,3.33,0
"There was sobbing. Quite a lot. 
 The last few chapters were a mess of emotions. I was sobbing, then completely over joyed, then horrified, more sobbing, shocked, even more tears, and then at the end a pile of happy tears. 
 Truly enjoyed this series. Though I have to admit Maxon was infuriating sometimes and some parts seemed over done by the end, those things shaped the book into what it was.

"Gabriel. I mean I love the way this story is. No love at first sight, slow, but stringing us along in the romance department, and a strong female lead who can be stupid at times, but is still pretty great. 
 But Gabriel. If you don't like anything else about this series read it for Gabriel. He's my favourite character by far, and just the way he's developed and the more you learn about him... ugh.

"Well... first off Kelley Armstrong is my FAVOURITE AUTHOR EVER.... ALLL her books are AMAZING.. especially DP and WOTOW 
 Secondly.... this book was too... how do I put it? happy endingyish... I mean the ending, cmon, after everything, THAT?!?! Gosh.. 
 Third.. I never liked DR too too much but I was really excited for the rising, for chloe and cuz I liked the series, I don't know. But this book honestly wasn't too good... I didn't like the cabals and how they were (WOTOW so much better), the choices (like wut?), and just the ending! 
 Fourth, DEREK AND CHLOE WERE COMPLETELY THE BEST PART... but how do I put this.. they seemed really different from DP and I mean I kinda get it but it kinda ruined it for me... 
 So.. this book was good, and as much as I want more... more would ruin the whole storyline for me... I think this one was just on the edge:)

 Kelley Armstrong is a genius, and if you've read the Women of the Otherworld series you'll notice subtle links between the two that get bigger as the series progresses, setting the 3 series (Including Darkest Rising) in the same universe, which makes it a more enjoyable and wonderful experience to fans of Kelley Armstrong's work.....

"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* 
 I would probably rate this book 1.5 stars out of 5 JUST because of its intense and creepy ass ending. I really did not enjoy how slow this book was until the last 80 pages or so. Amazingly, I got through it after putting this book down several times. 
 I've got to admit, I was drawn by the cover. It sounded pretty interesting, but I should've read a couple of pages in before renting it out at the library (glad I didn't pay for this book) because I totally did not know it was set in a high school setting. Blah! I hate those kinds of settings, but that's just my preference. 
 As for the plot... Sheesh! Was it really necessary for things to turn out like they did? I was shocked.. What kind of karma is that?! Hell, it really was unfair. I felt that it was a bit.. no, not even.. WAY too cruel for consequences. 
 The main character, Em, was pretty relatable which I liked a lot. She wasn't annoying; thank god! The other characters, not-so-likeable. They were quite bland when it came to being a complex character. Chase was just, wow, amazingly arrogant and totally irresponsible. A complete jerk who wouldn't be liable for any of his actions and swathed by the words or beauty of a Fury. Ergh, he had no backbone and I hated that. I enjoyed how Em turned out at the ending of the story and what she went through was PRETTY dang creepy. As I said, I loved the end but I definitely hated having to wait 300 pages until the story got interesting.

"I was pretty excited for this one but unfortunately... I was pretty disappointed. 
 The only part of the book that was interesting for me was the last 100 pages (Nook eBook edition); but that's just me. There were a lot of things going on but it wasn't as intensely mind-blowing like the other books in this series. Unlike the other books in this series (where I was hooked from the beginning to the end) I was struggling to actually finish this book until I reached those last 100 pages. I will admit that I enjoyed how she ended this book and I loved how she made readers think hard about Sebastian and his truthful plans. Besides that, I don't think I gained any new insight to any of the characters besides Simon's way of thinking when it comes to relationships.

"4.5 I'm-Obsessed Stars!! 
 Jessica Hawkins has written an engrossing and emotional romance that I simply couldn't put down! I am obsessed with Lake and Manning. Book #3 is releasing on 10/23 so if you've been waiting to start this series, don't delay! 
 ""Ten months. That was how long I'd gone without a fix. Lake's letters came every couple weeks. I'd opened the first one, but that was it. I'd known right then that if I was going to make it through this, I couldn't think of her. Couldn't be inside her head that way, and she definitely couldn't be inside mine."" 
 My heart broke for Lake and Manning. They endured years apart and obstacles at every turn. I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can't wait to find out! 
 ""But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake."" 
 This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!! Highly recommend this series for contemporary romance readers. I'm a Jessica Hawkins fan for life!! 
 "" I couldn't tell her I loved her. I couldn't tell her I didn't. It killed me, but that was how it was. It wasn't going to be any other way, no matter how many times she put me in this goddamn position.""

"4.5 Stars!! 
 ""Was sixteen too young to fall in love? I might've thought so before Manning. Could he love me back, a man seven years older? I was sure if he did, he'd never admit it. But I would wait for him. Even I understood that for a while, our ages mattered."" 
 As a longtime fan of Jessica Hawkins, I just knew I would love this book. And from the very first page, I was totally hooked. What a delight! A slow-burn, forbidden romance. My favorite! 
 This is the kind of book where the author takes her time describing a first meeting, a small moment, a conversation. Nothing is simply told, it is shown. I flew through this book, absolutely breathless with anticipation at what would happen next! 
 Lake and Tiffany are two sisters who both meet Manning at the same time. There's just one problem: Lake is only 16 years old. And Manning is a handsome construction worker with a past. 
 He half-smiled, one corner of his mouth lifting. That was the first I saw of his straight, white teeth. My heart skipped. Under the dirt, the sweat, the calluses, he was handsome. I'd known it already, peripherally, as I knew the direction of the beach or the artwork hanging in my dad's office. But now it was right in front of me. I couldn't miss it."" 
 Lake is a good girl: smart, studious and obedient. Tiffany is the wild child. But the interactions with their parents are nuanced and there is more to them than their labels. Although Tiffany seems flighty, she is much more appropriate for Manning than Lake. But who will get his heart? 
 ""Manning leaned his elbows onto his knees and watched her approach. My sister had that effect on men. They were always looking over or around me to see her. What'd he think when he looked at her? What'd he notice first?"" 
 I rarely have time to read a series back to back. But this book was so gripping and intense that I am immediately picking up the next book! I am obsessed with these characters and their story! 
 ""Some invisible tether existed between us. Nobody could see it, not even us, but I felt it. I was sure Manning did, too. As long as we both knew it, that was enough for me. For now, at least."" 
 Highly recommend this one. It has great pacing, a real setting and a gripping story. Don't miss it!!

"4.5 EPIC STARS!! 
 OMG what do I read now?! My heart is FILLED with Lake and Manning. A truly epic and passionate series. A must-read! 
 ""You wanted me to move on, so I did, and I no longer need you. You can't have it both ways."" 
 All the love to Jessica Hawkins for crafting an unforgettable and heart-wrenching love story. This series spans decades and is truly one of my favorite contemporary romance sagas ever. Lake and Manning have an emotional connection that is stunning, heartbreaking and simply beautiful. 
 How to write a review that is completely spoiler-free? Just know that this series kept me up many nights reading because I just had to know how Lake and Manning's epic journey was going to end. From two completely different worlds, these two only ever needed each other. Even if real life constantly got in their way. 
 ""I didn't know it would turn out this way, Lake. Your life, and mine, nothing is how I thought it would be."" 
 I literally read the books in this series back to back, and honestly had no clue where the author would take me as a reader. Ms. Hawkins stayed true to her main characters and developed the secondary characters perfectly. Dare I say that Tiffany was misunderstood? And that I would love to see a story based around her as well as Corbin? (But not together!) But this is Manning and Lake's story and I lived and breathed them for every page of this gorgeous story. Angst, joy, true love, heartbreak, despair - this series has it all and then some. 
 ""These are the pieces, and they might not look like much to you, but they're all I have. I've found a way to be happy. You can't come back into my life and tell me it's a mess when you're the one who created it."" 
 Manning is one of THE sexiest and most unforgettable main characters I've ever read. The self-sacrifice and heartache he endures is almost unbearable! And I literally felt as if I was THERE during the New York City scenes. 
 ""I thought I'd never have you, Lake, you have to understand that. I thought there was no chance. That people like me didn't get a life like this."" 
 Jessica Hawkins doesn't take any shortcuts and it shows in her writing. Nothing in this series felt rushed, forced or left undone. Every event felt necessary and fit perfectly. This is not an easy story to read - there is heartache, cheating, and tons of angst - but it was gripping and completely satisfying. If you love an adult, very sexy story with real depth and brutal honesty, then don't miss this series. And now I might actually have to do a re-read! 
 ""You and me, we're you and me.

"RACER EFFING TATE!! 
 Katy Evans is back, doing what she does best! 'Real' fans will swoon because Remy and Brooke's little boy Racer is all grown up! That being said, this hot sports romance is a standalone so you can still enjoy this book even if you haven't read any of the books in the series. 
 Lana's family's racing team is in desperate need of a driver. It's up to Lana to prove herself to her father and her brothers to find the best driver there is for their team. Chance leads her to Racer, famous in the world of illegal street racing. He's simply the best. 
 Lana takes a huge risk and hates Racer for her formula race car team. I loved the fast-paced description of the world of racing! Traveling all over the world for the races, Lana can hardly resist Racer, when he sets his sights on her and decides she's The One for him. 
 ""This is illegal,"" I state. 
 His voice is husky from exertion, and his eyes glint with laughter. ""That's why it's fun."" 
 Lana has a very protective family and a very sad past. But Racer Tate isn't going to let anything stop him. He also has a lot of secrets he's keeping, ones that will not only threaten his relationship with Lana but also his racing career. Will Lana and Racer be able to survive and overcome the obstacles that are in their way? 
 One of the things I love about Katy Evans is how she creates sexual tension with her characters. And it is off the charts here! Racer is intense on and off the racetrack, and Lana doesn't stand a chance! 
 ""Crasher ..."" He warns, sounding a little cocky. ""You go out with me and you'll never look back. I swear, baby."" 
 I enjoyed this sexy, passionate story very much. There is low angst so if you are in the mood for a sizzling sports romance with wit and crackling sexual chemistry, then you will LOVE Racer!! And fans of the 'Real' series will adore the way the cherished characters make appearances here. Happy reading!

"""You're the queen. I'm just a commoner. 
 GAH!!! MY HEART!!! This book was everything. One of the best-second chance romances I've ever read. 
 Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. 
 ""You don't know this, but that girl? She doesn't need a house. She doesn't even need an apartment. She would've slept in the car. She wouldn't have complained at all about it. You didn't have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She's worried, and she's scared, that this won't be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn't be there if she didn't. But the world isn't always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive."" 
 Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. 
 ""I don't deserve her time, not in the least, but I'm so desperate for some part of this woman back that I'll steal every second that I can get."" 
 Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging. I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison! The book is heartbreaking, sexy, funny, heartfelt and completely uplifting. 
 ""Whatever did it, I'm glad you're sober, and I hope you stay that way. For Maddie's sake, yeah, because she deserves to know her dad, but for your sake, too. I know I was never enough for you, Jonathan, but I hope you find something that is."" 
 This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroine's point of view. I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love. There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story. This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end. I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and self-sufficient. She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions. She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams. 
 ""Wherever it takes you, I'll be there.

"4.5 Addictive Stars!! 
 ""I'm Easton Royal, superficial and only interested in how to have a good time. 
 I don't want to look deep into my being and see the bottomless, black, boring pool of nothingness. I want to live in blissful denial."" 
 I am not a fan of over-the-top drama or crazy plots. So imagine my delight when I read 'Fallen Heir' almost in one sitting! Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. 
 Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. 
 ""I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don't-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend."" 
 This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton's story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! 
 ""I'm the only one here, drinking crap I can't stand because I don't want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head's a bad, bad place."" 
 I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. 'Fallen Heir' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. 
 ""I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don't move I'm gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you."" 
 I crack up. ""The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty."" 
 ""I'm thinking everything sounds dirty to you,"" she says dryly."" 
 This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you're looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story.

"Not sure how to rate this one. It started off as a beautifully painful story filled with lush descriptions of Northern California and the brutal reality of the main character Turtle's life. The writing then took a sharp turn for me into a very dark place. 
 Turtle was abused by her father for years and this book is filled with sadistic violence. The writing kept me reading until the end but the story was excruciating.

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 ""Loving another gives them power, it can be beautiful, fulfilling and as easy as breathing, but if I lose it again, it will destroy me."" 
 I think we all have a celebrity crush (or two!) For Heather, that person is Eli Walsh. She's loved him from afar ever since he was in a famous boy band. Heather has the chance to see him in concert and for just one night, she decides to let loose and forget the harsh realities of her day-to-day life. In a one-in-a-million chance, Eli notices her in the audience! They spend a fantastic evening together but Heather literally runs away. She has a lot on her plate and is a little embarrassed by what happened with Eli. 
 What could ever come out of a one-night stand with a rock star? Especially with Eli, who has a reputation as a playboy. Heather is very real, very grounded and very wary of men. She's recently divorced and because of her ex-husband, has terrible self-esteem. But Eli is intrigued! 
 Heather is devoted to her sister and doesn't have the time or emotion to devote to chasing a fantasy. Even though Eli and his band played a huge part in her life when she was younger, she cannot truly believe that someone like Eli would be interested in her. I loved how hard Eli worked to connive Heather that she was beautiful and sexy and deserving of his attention! 
 ""She's something completely different. For the first time, I don't have someone chasing me because of who I am."" 
 I love a good story about real-life people with real-life problems and real jobs. There are no billionaires here, just a rock star with a heart and a real woman with great friends and real heartache in her life. I didn't totally feel the connection between the main characters BUT I still very much enjoyed the story. Corinne Michaels fans will love this book. If you are in the mood for a little bit of fantasy, some raunchy humor and a good, old-fashioned happily-ever-after, then you'll love this story.

"""I'm ready for forever now."" 
 ""I'm ready for forever too,"" she whispers back. 
 WELL. Many thoughts on this one. Really FANTASTIC erotic scenes and overall I liked it. If menage is your jam, you will love this series. I absolutely tore through the first two books in this series and could not wait for the conclusion! 
 Many readers adored this third book which is mainly Ash's point of view. I'm still not quite sure what to say other than I was not really prepared for the turn of events that occurred in this story. Yes I LOVED the characters but some of the events seemed a little too fantastical for me. 
 The writing is complex and well-done and I loved the play on the King Arthur legend. At its heart this is the story of forbidden love and Greer, Embry and Ash are characters that I won't soon forget. 
 Sierra Simone took the famous legend of King Arthur and put her own sexy, passionate spin on the legendary characters. There is betrayal, love, passion and heartbreak - this series has it all. 
 American Prince ended on a heartbreaking cliffhanger but I absolutely loved how the author continued this storyline into Ash's book. These three are clearly destined to be together and I could not accept any other conclusion to their story! 
 ""What am I supposed to do? When the man who is supposed to love me hates me? When I can't protect the woman we both love?"" 
 So many forces conspire to pull Ash, Greer and Embry apart. But they simply could not live without each other. This book was filled with surprises and all in all, I loved this series. These books were stunning and sexy and highly erotic. There's lots and lots of kink but the series is very intelligent and very readable. Highly recommend for all erotic romance readers!

"JB Salsbury is my go-to author for sweet and sexy Alpha heroes and The Final Fight did not disappoint!! I absolutely adored this story and read it in one sitting. Passionate and funny and sexy and heartfelt. Don't miss this fabulous conclusion to the Fighting Series!! 
 Back to Las Vegas, the Final Fight does not so much focus on the fighting world as it does on the experiences of our war heroes. All of my favorite characters make an appearance though and the way the author ties everything together was incredibly satisfying. 
 AJ is pursuing her dreams of headlining as an acrobatic dancer in a Las Vegas show. For now, she's just one of the performers in a Cirque du Soleil-type show. But she dreams big. And nothing and no one will deter her from her dreams. 
 A Vegas casino is like its own planet--a virtually inescapable planet without obvious exit points. The sun or moon never makes an appearance, so the essence of time is completely lost. People are always milling about, and if it weren't for the coffee and pastry cart that opens at dawn and shuts down at noon, it would be impossible to tell morning from night. 
 Braeden is only in town for a short time on military leave. He is instantly drawn to AJ's wit and beauty and drive. He is not interested in a long-term commitment because he knows he can be shipped out anytime. I loved when these two met because they are both funny, driven and just very REAL. 
 ""You think too much."" He angles his upper body toward me, opening his chest and torso for my viewing pleasure. Not that seeing him is pleasurable. It's not that; it's . . . he clearly works out or he was blessed with fantastic genes. Not that I'm noticing. Or care. Whatever. 
 I really felt their intense connection which is SO important for me. Their chemistry is scorching hot but more than that, they share an emotional connection. Even though they both try to deny it. 
 ""I don't need promises. I only want to live in this moment with you, whatever that means, and not think about tomorrow or a week or a year from now."" 
 Circumstances and a series of miscommunications lead to Braeden and AJ being separated. JB Salsbury added just the right amount of angst so that the story moved forward but never felt forced. And can I say that I really liked AJ's boss, Andre? I felt that he was a little misunderstood and I can definitely feel another story there! 
 Braeden and AJ both have to overcome tragedy and curveballs thrown in their way. But their story is ultimately uplifting and inspiring and very, very emotional. Braeden especially was SO inspiring. 
 ""You'll be okay. We're going to get through this. We're gonna fight our way through this because we know no other way. And we're gonna do it together."" 
 Fans of the Fighting Series will LOVE how this series ends. 'The Final Fight' is fast-paced, sexy and funny in all the right places. I loved Braeden and AJ and their inspiring journey. 
 ""I will die before I let you go, you hear me? You'll be back. You'll be fighting for this shit too, but until you're there, until you get your fight back, I'm fighting for you.""

"""I promise to love you forever. As long as there is love in this world, we will be a part of it."" 
 So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it. 
 Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. 
 I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
 ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?"" 
 ""No, but are you going to paint it?"" 
 ""Paint what?"" 
 ""Us, what we just did?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""No?"" 
 ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred."" 
 The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. 
 Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? 
 It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. 
 This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! 
 ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time."" 
 ""You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?"" 
 ""Love, Charlotte.""

"4.5 Kinky Stars!! 
 Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! 
 ""Everyone is weird, Kate, we're the perfect kind of weird for each other."" 
 Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. 
 ""Her obsession wasn't even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. 
 But she thinks Ty can't stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she's actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. 
 ""Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? 
 This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn't believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* 
 Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. 
 ""Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology, wanting to cherish her was something else. Something much worse. 
 This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes. Eve Dangerfield is fearless! And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was. 
 Ty glared at her. ""Think you're funny, don't you, Middleton?"" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""Well we'll see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire."" 
 This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there. Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea, then do not read this one. BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink, as I am, then by all means read 'Act Your Age'! It is pure, growly Alpha-male goodness through and through. I can't wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next! 
 What he and Middleton shared had gravity, it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides.

"""Out of all the places we could be, we're right here. At the same time."" 
 Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in 'Without Merit'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. 
 ""I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. 
 Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. 
 Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin's boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. 
 Merit is angry and surly and can't seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? 
 ""I'm confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor's boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they're perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. 
 Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family's past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover's characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. 
 ""Sagan just doesn't say mean things out loud. Maybe that's a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he's some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals."" 
 I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here.

"Bey's kiss wasn't my first, but it was the only one that mattered. 
 Totally and utterly addictive, this duet blew me away. You must read book one (Maldeamores) first because this is the continuation of Lucky and Bey's story. To say that the first book ended on a cliffhanger is a slight understatement, but book two flawlessly flows right into the next chapters in the Lucky and Bey's lives. 
 Mara White is a master at writing taboo romance. She draws you into the main characters' hearts and minds and makes you FEEL their heartache, love and pain. This story is told in alternating points of view and alternates between the past and the present. Thus more is revealed about the angst and love and heartache that Lucky and Belen felt as they fell irrevocably in love with each other as children. 
 Biology causes our attraction and it's also the reason we have to stay apart. But it's the fate which worries me the most, and that I can't get a handle on. It is the physics of our love that disagrees with the universe. 
 Lucky and Belen suffered SO much I wasn't sure how Mara White would ever manage to give them the happy ending they deserved. Reading a book by Mara White is often like being on an emotional roller-coaster and I wasn't 100% certain where this ride would end! But her wonderfully rich and descriptive writing made this a book I simply couldn't put down. 
 ""I like your kind of trouble, Luciano,"" Bey says. She lays her mouth on my forearm in the ghost of a kiss. Arrows with poison flaming tips shoot down my limbs. 
 ""Don't say things like that, Len. You have no idea what you're getting into."" 
 ""I'm not afraid,"" she says and it's barely a whisper. 
 ""You should be,"" I say. I am. 
 I loved seeing Lucky and Bey as adults and read this book in one sitting. Highly recommend this duet for all fans of forbidden romance!! 
 Stay like this, Bey.

"""This is just the start, baby."" 
 Mamas, raise your boys to grow up like Asa. Holy hot single dad!! If bossy Alpha males are your jam, you'll LOVE 'Gifts'! I'm still sobbing from the Epilogue. Highly recommend! 
 This book has the elusive ""it"" factor that makes my heart race and my eyes tear up. Between laughing out loud. Oh and also it features a hot single dad who's over 40 and a 35 year old heroine with two children. This is my favorite book of the 'Killers' series but it can totally be read as a standalone. Jump right in and meet Brynne Asher!! This author NEEDS to be on your radar!! 
 This book had it all for me. Possessive Alpha, a smart and feisty heroine, real-life situations and very sweet and touching moments. If you love contemporary romance, you will LOVE this book!! Keelie was especially funny and very relatable. 
 ""I have a date. 
 Tonight. 
 At five o'clock. 
 Am I that old that I have to go on a date at five o'clock? Thirty-five is not old. Who the hell is she fixing me up with that wants to go on a date at five o'clock? I know it's been forever since I've been on a date, but five o'clock is for senior citizens--not women in their mid-thirties. 
 I'm ready to write off my first attempt at getting back into the game after more than a decade. I've decided the game sucks and I will be pleased as punch to sit on the sidelines. Others can go watch Netflix and fuck themselves for all I care."" 
 I absolutely LOVED Asa! He is raising two teenagers and has retired from his former very dangerous life. He doesn't have time to beat around the bush! He meets Keelie and in true Alpha fashion, makes his intentions very clear. 
 ""Keelie?"" Her brows pucker under the bill of her blue baseball hat. ""Hmm?"" 
 I lower my voice. ""We're adults. I don't need to date to know what I want."" 
 Did I mention that I loved Asa? He adores his kids but his daughter Emma is having a very rough time in high school. Only later does Asa find out the reason why. Keelie also has her hands full, with a full-time job, young children and a house filled with animals. But Asa accepts it all. 
 I lean in and we're as close as we've been all night. ""You date someone to figure out what you want. I know what I want and I think you do, too. It's the gift of life, Keelie. We just need to embrace it."" 
 Asa moves quickly in all things and when he sees an opportunity to be closer to Kellie and her family, he takes it. Keel's first husband was a great father but a terrible partner and she has trust issues, to put it mildly. 
 ""I have to warn you. I was using my kids as an excuse. You have to know that I'm a bit of a mess. More than a bit really. I'm just ... I don't know ..."" I sigh. ""Fucked up."" 
 He presses his hips into my stomach and I feel the long, hard length of his cock when he smiles down at me. ""Is it too soon to want to unfuck you by fucking you?"" 
 There's a very fast-paced storyline that's reminiscent of the Rock Chick series but at the heart of it all is the relationship between Keelie and Asa. This is a very witty, very sexy read that will satisfy every romance reader! I just loved these two together and actually cried at the Epilogue. Don't miss this one! 'Gifts' is romance at its best.

"Okay SO...this is the first book I have read in this series and I can honestly say that is can be read as a complete standalone! Often I am reluctant to read a book that is part of a series BUT the author does a great job of filling in the stories of the whole Lund clan. 
 Loved the premise of this book! Jensen Lund is a pro football and has firm dating rules. No single mothers, no cheerleaders AND no medical professionals. He is a football superstar who has been sidelined by an injury, and is recovering from surgery. Rowan Michaels is a beautiful single mom who also happens to be a professional cheerleader AND who also works in the field of athletic training!! The complete opposite of everything that Jensen thinks he needs. 
 Rowan is smart, tough and very professional. She has rules, too, like NEVER dating professional athletes. She is raising her young son on her own and has zero interest in men like Jensen. Excerpt that once she gets to know him, she realizes that he is smart, sensitive and driven - just like her. There is one big obstacle to their relationship, though - the football team has a very strict no-franternization rule between players and cheerleaders. 
 Rowan and Jensen both live the same apartment complex so they are neighbors. Hard to avoid each other, right? I loved that there was no insta-love here, but instead Rowan and Jensen's relationship was allowed to build and grow throughout the book. Ms. James is an incredible writer and she really created a wonderful story with these characters. I loved the slow-build romance between these two. And Rowan's adorable son added some light-hearted moments to the story. 
 Will Rowan and Jensen sacrifice their friendship for their professional careers? I adored the conclusion to this story! And the Lund family was captivating. This book is also super-sexy and has enticed me to start the other books in the series. A definite must-read for all contemporary romance lovers! 
 ""Ask me why I stayed away this week.""

"4.5 Stars!! 
 ""You're so full of yourself, you've already decided you're going to break my heart. Did you ever stop to think maybe it's me who will break your heart someday?"" 
 WOW!!!! I fell in love with Vi Keeland's writing with ""Worth the Fight' a few years ago, and 'Beautiful Mistake' highlights the BEST of her talents!! Sexxxxy romance, relatable characters, a great story...and a twist that I never saw coming. 
 I have read so many student/teacher stories lately but this book is SO much more!! Caine is a music professor and Rachel is his graduate student Teaching Assistant. I absolutely loved the them of music that ran through the book. How does music make you feel? What memories does music bring back for the listener? But this story is much more than the taboo relationship between Caine and Rachel. Both have secrets that are very slowly revealed through the book. How will those secrets affect their relationship? 
 Rachel has had a tough life and she is one feisty character! Funny. beautiful, kind and loving, she has made her share of mistakes but can't resist Caine's sex appeal. The dialogue is smart, light where it needs to be and the supporting characters are perfect. 
 ""Calm down in there. He isn't inviting you to a romantic dinner. He only wants you to help with his nieces. Put on a diaper, not take off your clothes."" 
 I was surprised by the depth and emotion in this story. Rachel and Caine's story will stay with me for a long time. Bravo, Ms. Keeland. Highly recommend 'Beautiful Mistake'!!

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 ""It would've been romantic if I wasn't drunk as a skunk when I dialed him."" 
 I am a die-hard Penelope Ward fan. I DEVOUR her books. And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon's family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. 
 However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. 
 Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn't quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward's main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! 
 His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. 
 'Drunk Dial' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. 
 Our story was a lot like a Rubik's Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together.

"If you love a sweet, verrrry sexy, low-angst romance, then this is the book for you! Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet super-hot contemporary romance. 
 Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. 
 There's tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What's not to love? After an embarrassing ""meet cute"" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It's not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. 
 The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There's not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn't want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. 
 ""The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I'd masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate."" 
 This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo.

"3.5 Stars 
 This was my first book by Jeannine Colette and I really enjoyed it! Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. 
 Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam's best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. 
 Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam's supervision, the sparks begin to fly. 
 Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan's early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! 
 Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn't just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. 'Wrecked' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours.

"4 - 4.5 Stars!! 
 ""If I ever lay eyes on you again... I can't promise I'll do what's best and walk away next time..."" 
 Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? 'The Forbidden' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that ""spark"" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. 
 Jack's marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. 
 ""I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack's my life. He's my pulse. He's everything."" 
 This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it!

"The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that's for sure - he's totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. 
 They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew's daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. 
 Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it's not enough to scare me away. In fact, it's the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. 
 The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. 
 ""I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can't handle it another second."" 
 I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew's relationship grew and developed. This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I can't wait to read what's next!!

"What an emotional and lyrical end to the series! Barbara Stewart is a gifted writer and her words sparkle on the page. This book is not what I expected and the author reveals Andy's complex character here. Don't miss this conclusion to the Rock and Roll Series. There are flashbacks to Andy's life with his beloved Bethy along with very revealing glimpses into his life and those who have left their mark on him. 
 I felt a bit of melancholy while reading this book. It is deeply reflective. However the tropical setting is so magical that I really felt all the emotions for Andy. All of the characters here are so richly drawn that felt like I really knew them.

"""Grabbing a bite. With a twenty-year-old. From a boy band. Under what circumstance might that ever be construed as acceptable?"" 
 I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. 
 A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, 'The Idea of You' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee's first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! 
 Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous ""boy band"". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene's relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. 
 Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as ""just lunch"" soon becomes much, much more. 
 ""I just want to look at you for a moment."" 
 ""You've been looking at me for over an hour."" 
 ""Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here."" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. 
 Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn't Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband's reaction to the news but also with her daughter's. 
 The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole. Face-first. 
 One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity. Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed, and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene. He was used to it; Solene was not. This story made me re-think every headline I read about celebrities. Hayes wanted Solene to know him, and NOT ""the idea"" of him. Hayes was tender, sweet, funny, sexy and much wiser than his 20 years. 
 ""You want to be kissed, Solene?"" His hands were in my hair, pushing it off of my face, cradling my neck. 
 ""Yes."" I nodded. 
 ""You think you can handle that?"" 
 ""I'll see what I can do."" 
 Robinne Hill gets her locations right. From Miami, to Malibu, to Manhattan and Paris, I felt as if I was THERE, experiencing the cafes, the clubs, the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts. This book really checked all the boxes for me!! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. I am having a hard time moving on from this book. Would I love a sequel? YES. But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms. Hill. Grab 'The Idea of You' and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read. I adored it. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""You're making me blush,"" he laughed, tipping his head back. His jawline from this angle was well-defined, exquisite, like art. His beauty, like a gift that kept revealing itself. 
 ""Love,"" she said, ""was not always perfect, and not exactly how you expected it to be. But when it descended upon you, there was no controlling it.""

"4 - 4.5 Stars!! 
 OMG!! Refreshing, smart, fun and swoony, I LOVED this book!! It was just what I needed. My favorite R.S. Grey book since 'Scoring Wilder'. If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! 
 Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) 
 They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam's nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! 
 ""No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal."" 
 ""Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do."" 
 ""That's when I thought you'd be asking me for a lung or something!"" 
 ""So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?"" 
 ""Don't try to be cute."" 
 Adam's family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn't be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. 
 ""And you brought cookies?"" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. 
 ""Freshly baked this morning,"" I brag. 
 She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who's following us into the house with Mouse by his side. ""I love her already!"" 
 I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I've had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I'll date Adam's mom? 
 'The Foxe & the Hound"" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat. I loved the banter, the characters and the charming small-town Texas setting. I swear, R.S. Grey could be a TV comedy writer, that's how funny her dialogue is!! 
 ""I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights, but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago. Instead, I'm forced to stand, hang up on Daisy, and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand. We're the first two to arrive. She takes her usual spot beside Helen's chair, and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table. Her perfume is strong. Chanel number five, she told me once, bragging. Oh really? On you it smells like a number two. 
 This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach. I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton, Texas. Bravo, Ms. Grey!! Keep writing more books like this one. 
 ""We should slow down,"" I sputter just before his mouth falls to my chest.

"3.5 - 4 stars 
 Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spin-off from the Nine Minutes series. Lots of unexpected twists and turns! 
 I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony's early life. 
 I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen! 
 Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. 
 He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. 
 Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. 
 Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book!

"4.5 - 5 Stars!! 
 ""When life happened, it did it in a heartbeat. That space between time. A first inhale, a last exhale. The dawn of realization, the eve of what was and never again would be."" 
 What an unexpected and refreshing surprise!!! This book is unlike anything I've ever read. And please don't read any spoilers! The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS! 
 Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC's EVER. Strong, funny, self-deprecating, she is basically just waiting for her life to begin. She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position she's in. But there is so much more to her story!! 
 ""If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery."" 
 This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything. 
 ""Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot. She lived a hundred yards away. 
 This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL. I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters. It is another delightfully different story from one of the best indie authors writing today. Pick up 'When Life Happened.' You will be delighted and challenged and entertained.

"4.5 Darkly Delicious Stars!!! 
 Adult, sexy and daring. Brianna Hale gets better and better. 
 ""His singing voice can rattle windows with fury or caress with love."" 
 Ahhhhh....Frederic. Each hero of Brianna Hale strikes all the right notes with me. Having devoured her first two books, I could not wait to read 'Soft Limits.' A little darker than her previous books, this story has a little more depth and seriousness and I absolutely could not put it down! There are certain authors I just ""click"" with and Ms. Hale is one of them. You can count on tons of kink, flawless writing and a superb storyline. And a happy ending! Always. 
 If you have been wanting to try a little daddy/little girl kink, then by all means get your feet wet with Brianna Hale. I adored Evie and loved her exploration of her darker side. A brilliant writer in her won right, she has always searched for something more....and she finds it with Frederic D'Estang. 
 ""It's not just that I like make-believe. I crave it. And lately, I crave make-believe about villains most of all."" 
 Evie is tasked with writing Frederic's biography. He is a famous performer and is hiding a dark secret of his own, Slowly they begin to get to know each other and realize that they have an almost unbreakable bond. They share the same unusual desires and fit each other perfectly. One thing i love about Brianna Hale's books is that there is no shame involved with her characters - everything is explored in a heathy and safe way. And I loved the age difference between Evie and Frederic! 
 ""There are a few reasons someone might be a hero, but there are infinite reasons to be a villain."" 
 There is a slightly gothic feel to this book which sets it apart from the earlier books. All set in London, the city plays a vital role in Ms. Hale's books. I loved the lush descriptions of the city and of the countryside. I promise that once you pick this book up, you won't be bale to put it down! And there's plenty of lightness to balance out the darker elements. All in all, a wonderfully sexy, very adult love story. Highly recommend! 
 ""Frederic isn't afraid of my vulnerability, he craves it.""

"From the book cover, to the story, to the ending, I absolutely adored this book! I rarely have time to binge read anymore but I read this book right after finishing 'Little Dancer'. Something about Ms. Hale's writing just clicks with me. 
 Dieter is hired as a bodyguard to protect Adrienne in the wake of a very public scandal involving her father. She does not agree to this arrangement, and fights both her father and Dieter at every turn. 
 A dominant Alpha, Dieter is former SAS and will do anything to protect the sassy Adrienne. The writing in this story is strong, the scenes between Dieter and his ""principal"" hotter than hot, and the London setting is perfect. 
 A total guilty pleasure from beginning to end, this book is hotter than hell with a fabulous HEA. I can't wait for Ms. Hale's next book!! 
 ... 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ... 
 Dieter leans down and whispers in my ear and his voice is silkier, more dangerous than ever. ""Don't ask for things, little girl, if you're not prepared for the consequences."" 
 ... 
 I've relinquished some control over to him and I...like it? I think about his hands wrapped around my wrists or my throat, and a hot sensation chases through my body. 
 I'm attracted to my bodyguard. 
 ... 
 ""It's a goddamn miracle,"" he mutters, his hands roving over my skin, ""that I haven't given you the spanking of your life, all the lip you've given me.""

"4.5 Captivating Stars!!! 
 ""When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie."" 
 -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko 
 'The Child's is a haunting and emotional character-driven suspense novel that also explores our modern-day obsession with 24/7 news. 
 Angela's newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier. The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. 
 Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author's previous book 'The Widow' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate's style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. 
 ""I've always thought that's a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don't they?"" 
 Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the ""Building Site Baby' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela's family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. 
 The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. 
 'The Child' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. 
 There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. 
 ""People say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn't. It breaks your bones, leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape. Creaking along the fault lines, Fragile and exhausting to hold together. Sometimes you wish it had killed you.""

"4.5 ""Yes, Daddy"" Stars!! 
 WELL, HELLO!! Welcome to the judgment-free zone! If you are just the tiniest bit curious about the DDlg genre (that's ""Daddy Dom/little girl""), then please enjoy this absolutely delicious confection by Brianna Hale. I read this book in a few hours and it was one of the most heart-warming, sexy, taboo and romantic stories I've ever read. 
 Abby is a young dancer who comes alive when onstage. She can barely cope with the realities of day-to-day life, but feels completely at ease when she is dancing at the Palais Theatre. Still living with her parents, she is shy, innocent and very inexperienced. 
 When I'm onstage, and all there is, is the music and the sweet burn of exertion and the glare of the hot lights, I'm me. 
 Imagine Abby's surprise (and delight!) when the handsome, stern and very bossy theatre owner Rufus Kingsolver takes an interest in her. 
 Oh boy. Mr. Kingsolver. He is good at reading people and he knows just what Abby needs. This book should come with a warning label because it is that hot. Abby finally feels that someone understands her and all of her odd habits. She acts like a little girl in many ways, because it soothes and comforts her, and she is PERFECT for Rufus! 
 ""It's such a relief to know that there are other people like me. I'm not strange, or weird, or stupid. 
 THIS BOOK. I loved it! I thoroughly enjoyed every word. Please pay attention to book description and if it turns you off, do not read this. But if you love a hot, quick read, this is the book for you. I was fascinated by the Daddy Dom world and also the way in which Abby grew as a person over the course of the story. 
 He strokes his thumb over my cheek and it comes away glittery. I'm dropping glitter all over him. ""I missed you, little one."" 
 ""I'm so sorry I caused us so much pain and I said Persephone and I wasn't brave enough."" 
 ""You're the bravest person I know, babygirl. Look at all that you've done."" He pulls a tissue out of his pocket and wipes my tears, and then puts it over my nose. ""Blow."" I do. The tissue comes away glittery, too. 
 ""I'm getting glitter all over you,"" I say with a shaky laugh. 
 He presses his forehead against mine. ""Please get glitter all over me,"" he whispers. ""Drown me in it."" 
 There are BDSM elements in this story but it is surprisingly romantic and tender. I loved it so much that I am diving right into the next book by Ms. Hale, Princess Brat. Because sometimes you just need to escape with a few hours of fun, sexy fantasy!

"""This woman could be my downfall. Could make me forget who I am. All I am."" 
 Jodi Ellen Malpas at her best! Drew's story is perfect for fans of The Lord Jesse but any romance lover will absolutely devour this steamy short story. 
 Drew is one of the group of Jesse Ward's best friends from the 'This Man' trilogy. He is a devoted father to young Georgia and the very successful head of a London real estate agency. Since Jesse closed The Manor, Drew must go elsewhere to have fun.. He is most definitely NOT looking for a lasting relationship. His daughter and his business come first. 
 Raya is only interested in an emotionless, no-strings-attached session. But Drew is unlike anyone she's ever met and once he's been with Raya, Drew cannot stop thinking about her. 
 Anything more would give away this fun and sexy and engaging novella. This story is really not a standalone and probably should only be read and enjoyed after reading the 'This Man' series. 
 I LOVED Drew's interactions with Jesse and Ava and the whole crew from 'This Man'. This novella is funny, HOT and perfect for readers wishing for more from this fantastic series of books. Thank you Ms. Malpas! Adored this juicy short story.

"SOOOO sweet and hot!!! I ADORE second-chance romances and 'The Lucky Heart' is a PERFECT example of this genre done right!! Devney Perry has become an auto-read author for me. I love her blend of sweet, sexy, Alphas and compulsively readable storylines with a bit of suspense thrown in. 
 ""This time around, I didn't want her running to me as an escape. This time around, I wanted her to finally choose me just because I made her happy. "" 
 While the other characters from the earlier books make appearances here, this book can be read and enjoyed as a complete standalone. Felicity is back in her Montana hometown after many years away. She is a former ""mean girl"" who is trying her best to make amends with her family and friends. A terrible, life-altering tragedy occurred when she was a young woman and she is determined to seek forgiveness from all who were affected by her actions. 
 Silas has always loved Felicity, but she broke his heart when she left town suddenly. Can I just say: OMG SILAS!!!! Devney Perry creates THE sweetest, sexiest, HOTTEST Alpha heroes!! Silas is hard-working, loving, loyal and kind but tough when he needs to be. Felicity broke his heart once, but he is not going to let her go again. And he won't let anyone disrespect her, either. 
 ""Now that she was back in Montana, I wasn't letting her go. I'd play it slow and steady. Put in the time. But one day she'd be mine. 
 Just like she was always meant to be. 
 Silas and Felicity have a complex relationship. There are a lot of external forces working against them. I loved watching a trust and friendship develop between them. This is just a gorgeous story, filled with scenes from a working ranch, life in Montana and even the dangers of addiction. This is a big, beautiful story, much like how I imagine life in small-town Montana to be! 
 ""I love that you get all shy when I give you a compliment,"" he said into my hair. ""But don't hide that smile from me, Lis. I live for it."" 
 There's plenty of action in this story and excellent character-building. I adore Devney Perry's writing style and can't wait for the next story in this series. Plus, I am a sucker for a good Epilogue and this one was PERFECT

"Such a sweet and sexy story! Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. 
 I'm a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse's friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It's no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. 
 ""Nick?"" Gigi asked, but I didn't speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. 
 ""Sorry. I have to go,"" she mumbled before racing to the door. 
 ""What was that? Do you know her?"" Jess asked. 
 Yeah. I knew her. ""She's my wife."" 
 There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there's a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. 
 Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn't know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the ""wow"" factor that 'The Coppersmith Farmhouse' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. 
 I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. 'The Clover Chapel' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word. I am thrilled that the third book in the series, 'The Lucky Heart' is coming in August! I can't wait to return to Jamison Valley.

"""Now I know how much there is to be afraid of and it terrifies me. But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?"" 
 This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! 
 ""Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn't die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better."" 
 John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. 
 ""You're here?"" 
 ""Yeah."" 
 ""Why?"" 
 ""Because this is where you are,"" he said, as if it were obvious.

"4.5 ""Big Red"" Stars!! 
 OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. 
 ""You're stunning,"" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. 
 ""Thanks."" 
 Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. 
 Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! 
 He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual."" 
 Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. 
 ""You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?"" 
 Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has ""it."" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened."" 
 ""They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost 
 c--t.'""

"Andrea Dunlop is hands down one of my favorite ""new"" authors. 'Losing the Light' is a top favorite read for me this year (released in 2016). So when I got the chance to read this novella to ""tide"" me over until her next full-length release, I jumped on it!! 'Broken Bay' is a fast-paced, modern tale about a group of old friends who gather for a bachelorette weekend. Even though this is a short story, the characters are all well-developed and the setting quite detailed. And the cover is perfect!! Throw in an old ghost story and some old secrets, and you have a heady cocktail about friendship, loyalty and love. A quick read by a very talented author.

"""He was so addictive. Like candy. Or drugs. One taste of him had me fiending and my heart beating out of my chest."" 
 OH YES!!! I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! 'Illegal Contact' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! 
 Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. 
 Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. 
 ""I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed."" 
 Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. 
 ""Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist."" 
 Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. 
 ""The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion."" 
 ""I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion."" 
 I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. 
 I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. 
 When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! 
 Gavin cocked a brow. ""If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations.

"4.5 STARS!! 
 ""Even though he lit up the room for everyone else, he only saw me. 
 AAHHHH!!!! I cannot believe this is my first Santino Hassell book!! I LOVE his writing style!! Don't be put off by this being the fifth book in a series, it can stand alone in my opinion and also made me curious about the other books and characters in this amazing Five Boroughs world. 
 This story felt very modern and relevant, mainly because the MC Ashton is an Instagram ""star."" He is rich, gorgeous, and his life looks fabulous. From the outside. In reality, he is the classic ""poor little rich boy,"" looking for true love and instead hooking up endlessly with meaningless one-night stands. 
 Val is a boxer from a poor family, the son of Ashton's nanny. He grew up with Ash and has had a crush on him since they were kids. Val sees the ""real"" Ash, the kind, generous and loving boy that he grew up with. 
 ""The real Ashton--the quirky bastard with the smart-ass smile and thrift-store style--could get me to do anything. The Ashton he played for the rest of the world didn't have the same power."" 
 Ash is living a reckless life, filled with endless parties and endless men. Val will protect Ash at all costs, even at the expense of his intense training schedule. Val is a rising star in the boxing world and lives a clean lifestyle. 
 Val always felt like an outsider in Ashton's world. Yet he was always there for him no matter what. Val never felt worthy of Ash and even though he has been secretly in love with Ash for years, Val doesn't believe that Ash could ever love someone like him. 
 ""Even amid other rich folks and socialites, Ashton stole all the attention in the room. Elegant, and gorgeous, and so damn unique that people had paused in their own conversations to watch him approach. His presence was magnetic, and people were helplessly drawn to him. Myself included."" 
 Much of this book is spent with the two MC's in a dance around each other: both afraid to admit their true feelings BUT unable to deny the powerful attraction between them. The writing is beautiful and funny and painful all at once. Would these two gorgeous souls from very different worlds ever find their way back to each other? 
 ""I could never stop thinking about Ashton, and I would never stop missing the quiet moments when it was just us and he was a devastatingly beautiful force of nature that had calmed just for me. 
 Santino Hassell has now become a favorite author of mine. And I adore the SMOKING hot scenes between Ashton and Valdrin. OMG!! They burned up the pages. Bravo to you, Mr. Hassell! This book had everything I love about contemporary MM romance. Can't wait to read more from this author.

"3.5 Stars 
 I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. . 
 ""It's never been a game with you."" 
 Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. 
 Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? 
 ""He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about."" 
 There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. 
 I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one!

"4.5 I'm-Obsessed Stars!! 
 Jessica Hawkins has written an engrossing and emotional romance that I simply couldn't put down! I am obsessed with Lake and Manning. Book #3 is releasing on 10/23 so if you've been waiting to start this series, don't delay! 
 ""Ten months. That was how long I'd gone without a fix. Lake's letters came every couple weeks. I'd opened the first one, but that was it. I'd known right then that if I was going to make it through this, I couldn't think of her. Couldn't be inside her head that way, and she definitely couldn't be inside mine."" 
 My heart broke for Lake and Manning. They endured years apart and obstacles at every turn. I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can't wait to find out! 
 ""But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake."" 
 This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!! Highly recommend this series for contemporary romance readers. I'm a Jessica Hawkins fan for life!! 
 "" I couldn't tell her I loved her. I couldn't tell her I didn't. It killed me, but that was how it was. It wasn't going to be any other way, no matter how many times she put me in this goddamn position.""

"3.5 Stars 
 Sweet, sexy, small-town romance with not a lot of angst or tension. I am a huge fan of Harper Sloan's writing and her oh-so-sexy Alpha males so I had high hopes for this story. This is Maverick's book, he is a famous bull rider on the rodeo circuit but must cut his career short due to injuries. 
 He returns home to the family and town he left behind and the sweet and beautiful Leigh, who has loved him since she was a young girl. She also happens to be Maverick's sister's best friend! 
 There are plenty of sweet, sexy times in this book but the central conflict was worked out pretty early on. There are also lots of down-home, small-town feels to this book and all in all, it was an easy, steamy read. Of course the best scenes are between Maverick and Leigh. This book was perfectly enjoyable but it just didn't thrill me like Harper's earlier books. 'Lost Rider' is a great summertime read when you crave some sweet, country lovin'. 
 ""I can't fix the past... I can't erase it, no matter how hard I wish I could. Hell, I can't even promise that I'll ever be able to forget it... The only thing I can do is to make sure that each day I live is worth somethin', from this day forward.""

"4 - 4.5 SEXXXXY STARS!! 
 ""Sex is for the body. Romance is for the soul."" 
 OH YES!! Part 'Hitch' and part 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days', 'Mister Romance' is a delightfully sexy and warm-hearted romance that will thrill all contemporary romance lovers. 
 I am a HUGE fan of Leisa Rayven. You can always count on this author to deliver a steamy, well-written story, and she lives up to her reputation with this yummy book. Surprisingly emotional yet funny and sharp, I enjoyed every minute of this fast-moving story. Eden Tate is stuck in a dead-end job that she hates. She is a smart and driven journalist but must land a big story in order to move up to a better position. She hears a rumor of a ""Mister Romance"", a mysterious man who acts as an escort to some of Manhattan's wealthiest and elite women. She is determined to uncover his true identity. 
 Sounds cliche, no? But this story is much more than your standard rom-com. Eden has some heavy trust issues and ""M.R."" actually beats her at her own game and turns the tables on her. And surprise! 'M.R."" aka Max Riley is sexy and smart and just might be the one who shows Eden how to open her heart. 
 This story had my heart pounding and had me cheering for Eden and Max. And the steamy scenes between Eden and Max are BURNING HOT!! I fell in love with all the characters in this book and their love story made me swoon. Highly recommend this book if you need some funny, romantic and light-hearted reading. And be prepared to be THRILLED by Max Riley!!

"4.5 Stars 
 Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. 
 Some books have ""it"" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. 'The Unrequited' has ""it."" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. 
 ""Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. "" 
 Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla's story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! 
 ""The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be."" 
 Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. 
 But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla. You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together, but you just can't look away.",16,4,1,339,28.9,47.05,17.54,23.97,10.27,17.99,85.55,68.73,54.87,11.8,7.08,1.47,0.0,1.77,3.83,0.0,4.72,13.27,5.31,1.18,10.03,10.03,6.19,9.73,1.47,15.93,9.14,3.54,3.83,1.47,0.29,2.06,9.73,1.18,8.55,1.18,0.0,1.18,1.47,0.88,4.72,0.0,10.03,4.72,4.42,4.13,2.06,1.18,0.0,0.29,0.59,0.29,12.68,5.6,0.29,0.29,1.18,1.18,1.47,7.37,0.29,0.0,2.95,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.24,0.29,0.0,2.65,0.0,0.29,1.77,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.29,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.29,6.49,9.14,1.18,2.36,6.19,0.88,0.0,0.29,2.06,3.24,5.9,0.88,0.29,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.0,23.01,8.55,5.01,0.59,2.36,1.77,4.72,0
"Fun, surprisingly witty and verrrry sexy!! 
 I LOVE the enemies-to-lovers romance trope and Ann-Marie Walker executes perfectly. This story has heart and heat and soul! 
 Coleman and Olivia seem an unlikely pair: she's an activist who hates everything Coleman stands for: wealth, privilege and corporate America. Their smart and witty banter and the uber-steamy sex scenes elevate this contemporary romance above many in the genre and make this story a definite must-read. The Chicago setting is fabulous! 
 Looking for a smart and sexy beach or poolside read?Then grab 'Black Tie Optional' and enjoy a few delicious hours of escape.

"""You smile like the devil,"" Mona said. 
 ""The devil doesn't smile,"" he said. ""The devil smirks."" 
 STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. 
 But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. 
 ""You were meant to do this,"" he said softly. ""You'll see."" 
 ""Why me?"" she asked. ""Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?"" 
 ""Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James."" 
 And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. 
 I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. 
 ""Is this all a dream?"" That's the only thing that makes any sense. 
 ""You aren't dreaming,"" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. ""But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?"" he asked. 
 A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. 
 ""Never."" 
 I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!!

"""Nothing about us makes sense except for what I feel when I'm with you."" 
 Loved this raw and sexy story!!! Ms. Salsbury has a gift for writing Alpha males and creating tortured, damaged souls. Aden and Sawyer are two lonely people who are 
 brought together by a twist of fate...or is it by design? Sawyer makes a promise to her dying sister and travels to California to pack up her apartment. Aden suffers from extreme PTSD and can't let anyone get close to him. 
 Sawyer and her sister are polar opposites - Sawyer is controlling, compulsive and rigid while her sister is carefree and lives life to the fullest. Fulfilling her sister's wishes forces Sawyer to step outside her comfort zone and really jump into life with abandon. Aden carries around the burden of tremendous guilt for things that happened during war. Can he love Sawyer without hurting her? 
 I couldn't put this book down once I started! The writing is terrific. There are lots of colorful characters and even a 'Jaws' reference! I hope Ms. Salsbury writes ore books like 'Wrecked.' The Epilogue was outstanding. I loved it!!

"I absolutely love when Mara White and K. Larsen get together. Their writing flows seamlessly and their stories feel so REAL. I felt that I knew Ryan and Jackie, lived through their emotional highs and lows and and felt their pain. 
 This story is emotional, romantic, sexy and epic. The book spans many years but through it all, Ryan loved Jackie more than anything, even when she tried to place him firmly in the friend zone. 
 Jackie was always scared of an emotional attachment so Ryan was her best friend. Ryan did everything just to love her and and even stood by while both their lives went on, even though she was his one true love. 
 Years pass and Ryan and Jackie are separated by circumstance and by life. Will Ryan and Jackie ever find their happily ever after? He is just the perfect man, completely devoted to Jackie yet willing to give her time and space. This is a very angsty book but at the same time, filled with hope and romance. 
 The ending was a complete surprise which I did not see coming in a million years. Once again these two authors have delivered an emotional, sexy, real and gritty romance. Ryan and Jackie are two memorable characters, and their story is one I won't soon forget.

"""We got here, baby, through fire and blades, demons and curses, blood and plagues."" 
 Just WOW. I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list! 
 ""Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?"" 
 This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire. 
 Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts. 
 ""Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it."" 
 'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO. 
 My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending.

"""I'm curious whether you could ever like me, whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me."" 
 Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! 
 Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. 
 Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although ""out"" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. 
 ""Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories."" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. 
 Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? 
 ""But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?"" 
 My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. 
 I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. 
 There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. 
 Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. 
 These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. 
 Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a ""half-Jew in a Mormon town"" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.) 
 Hopefully the LDS Church will have a ""revelation"" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church.

"I ALWAYS love a Kitty Thomas book! This one is dark yet very intriguing and sexy. It can be read as a standalone. 
 This story started off very promising for me. I was fascinated by Julie, who worked as a waitress in a bar but dreamed of a normal life and family. Gabe was a regular customer who finally asked Julie out on a ""normal"" date. It was pretty clear from the beginning that Gabe was not interested in the white-picket-fence thing. 
 I love a dark story but this one felt just a little rushed for me. The story took a very surprising turn at the beginning. Gabe comes to Julie's rescue but he is far from a knight in shining armor. He is very clear about his intentions right the start. Julie has feelings for Gabe and wants to please him but is not sure she can ever accept his lifestyle. 
 I liked that Gabe never apologized for who he is. He wants to take care of Julie. I felt that Julie's wide-eyed innocence was little unrealistic but this story was engrossing enough that I wanted to see where her and Gabe's story ended up. 
 I loved the scenes with Gabe and Julie together. This book was not as heavy on the erotic, steamy scenes as I would have expected, but I loved the plot and the pacing. Would Julie ever learn to trust Gabe and her true feelings? 
 Kitty Thomas is an incredible writer and I absolutely love her books. 'Surrender' ended a little abruptly for me and while this story was not my favorite, I will continue to read anything this woman writes!

"What a ride!! Action-packed, SEXXXXY story. This book MUST be read after 'Jacked Up' so I'll keep this spoiler-free. Elle Aycart writes some of THE best contemporary romance stories and she delivers the goods plus some with this story. Nico's story is a wild ride and is a nice addition to anyone's romantic suspense library. 
 ""...you are unraveling me piece by piece, and I fucking hate it."" 
 Ms. Aycart has created some very memorable characters in her books and this one is no exception. I loved the goth love interest here who really gives Nico a run for his money.

"""My life began and ended with them."" 
 Loved the series!! Must be read together and in order. Very adult, very sexy and very erotic. 
 I don't shy away from love triangles so if you are a fan, by all means read this series. The first book is my favorite of the three and does an outstanding job of creating the beautiful and unbreakable bond between Danni and Cole and then...Trace! Yes, the author makes you believe that is possible to fall in love with two men. And now that the trilogy is complete, you can dive right into this angsty yet verrrry sexy series. 
 I am going to keep this review short because I really don't want to give anything away about this book. I LOVED how Danni really held all the power in this book and was totally blindsided by the ending. BUT I loved how Pam Godwin wrapped this story up and I read this book in almost one sitting. The whole series is very fast-paced and fun and addictive and sexy. I loved both Cole and Trace, and could not imagine how this story would play out. 
 ""This is your world."" He spreads his arms wide. ""I just live in it. You own my heart, my every thought. You have the power to take whatever you want when you want it."" 
 Danni faces an almost-impossible decision in this book but there are no easy answers and the author certainly does not take the easy way out. I am usually not a huge fan of serials/series with cliffhangers but I loved this one and now that the story is complete, you can dive right in and read the whole trilogy. Was I emotional while reading this book? Yes. Was I rooting for both Cole AND Trace? YES!! But I love a good roller-coaster-ride of a story and Pam Godwin really delivered all the emotions.

"I don't understand the enigma of love, only that it holds me hostage, cares for and worships me, abandons and breaks me, and always lures me back for more. 
 Danni Angelo's life was completely disrupted and her world torn apart when she lost her first great love Cole. Time moved on and she found love again with Trace, a sexy, sophisticated and very different man than Cole. Trace was Danni's second chance at happiness. 
 Danni never stopped loving Cole but now that she has fallen for Trace, Cole has reappeared in her life! So much must be explained and SO much is revealed in this second book in the series. How can Danni choose between two men who are her soulmates? And Cole and Trace deserve happiness, too! 
 ""Cole. My first love. My greatest loss. 
 Trace. He's supposed to be my new beginning. My future. 
 Danni is not the ""bad guy"" for falling in love with two men. She never stopped loving Cole. But he was presumed gone. And now she needs some space to decide how to work this out or even if they can all her come to some kind of agreement. 
 Both Cole and Trace are deeply in love with Danni and will do whatever it takes to come out on top. Sexual tensions run high. This isn't a typical love triangle in my opinion because Danni assumed Cole was long gone before she ever let herself have feelings for Trace. 
 There are many more secrets and lots of intrigue in the story. Danni's life might be in danger due to the nature of Cole and Trace's work. Danni decides that she needs a break from Cole and Trace to decide what she wants to do with their relationship. 
 I agree with some reviewers that this book was a total mind f**k!I felt just as torn between these two men as Danni did! They were both sexy and loving and protective. Yes this book does end on a cliffhanger but I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. Who will Danni give her heart to, body and soul? What will happen with Trace and Cole and the mystery package at the end of 'Two Is A Lie'? I can't wait to see!!

"""Because love doesn't end with death. It doesn't shrivel and disintegrate with the ashes. It hovers, follows, haunts the living."" 
 OH YES!!! My love Pam Godwin is back!! I devoured this morsel of a sweet and dirty story in a few hours and I CANNOT WAIT FOR MORE! Pam Godwin can pack more heart, soul and heat into a few paragraphs than most and I absolutely fell in love with Danni and Trace. Yes, this ends on quite the cliffhanger but it is not a total surprise. And getting there is all the fun. 
 He's compelling, gorgeous, powerful. The kind of man a woman wants at her side, united and tangled, fighting for her, not against her. 
 There are lots of romance tropes at play here but they all just WORK. I am a huge fan of Pam Godwin's writing and I adored this story. Since there is a huge cliffhanger, this review will be completely spoiler-free other than to mention that the story is HOT, fast-paced and has touches of humor!! Danni's wit and sarcasm was a welcome relief from the storyline. 
 Read this book, the next book in the series releases in July and you will have your answers! (We'll, almost!) I don't know what will happen with Trace and Danni but I cannot wait to find out!!

"First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books. And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. 
 The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. 
 Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. 
 ""My arms outstretched, I'd danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang."" 
 And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. 
 But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. 
 ""One day you're going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I'll be here waiting for you,"" he whispers softly, his words a caress. ""Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn't please me to share you with others after all."" 
 There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn't work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books! 
 Favorite quote: 
 ""Il n'y a qu'un bonheur dans la vie, c'est d'aimer et d'etre aime."" There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.

"""You're all mystery, Vera. Half-truths and bold statements, but you hide everything about you."" 
 This was my first book by Rachel Higginson and I throughly enjoyed it! It is a smart, witty, feel-good, sexy romance. Vera is a talented chef who spent time in Europe to escape from a toxic relationship. She used to dream of owning her own restaurant, but she now does the next best thing: she opens a food truck featuring her very inspired food creations. 
 Vera parks her food truck in the parking lot of her brother's shop and it is directly across the street from a famous restaurant that employs the renowned Chef Killiam Quinn. Who is also famously difficult and temperamental. Killian actually sends one of his employees over to Vera's food truck to sample her creations and has the nerve to critique her techniques! 
 And so begins a classic enemies-to-lovers story that was completely engrossing and very well-written. No insta-love here! Instead the author treats us to an intense slow-burn romance with fantastic dialogue and very well-developed characters. 
 ""I looked into his eyes, but it turned out to be a mistake. He was too intense. Too overwhelming. He was everything hot and exciting, interesting and new."" 
 I love heroes main who are gruff, caustic and tough. Killian is a brilliant chef but he is closed off from forming an intimate relationship. While this might seem like a tired storyline, Rachel Higginson gives it a fresh spin and a very modern twist. The characters are all memorable and the dialogue is fresh and real. And I loved the whole idea of food truck vs. fancy restaurant - kind of a David and Goliath twist on this enemies-to-lovers story! Plus there is plenty of hot sexy times to satisfy every romance lover. This is a very original book, and I can't wait to read more from this incredible author! 
 ""He was Killian Quinn, and he wasn't perfect. And I wanted to lick him from head to toe.""

"4.5 Delicious Stars!! 
 ""Curse this No Man Diet. Curse it. 
 If you like your happily-ever-after with a side of naughty, then this book is for you!! I love Nicola Rendell's breezy, snappy writing style and her sex scenes are NOT to believed!! Grab me a fan!! 
 Penny Darling is a small-town girl who has sworn off men (for now). She literally bumps into Russ at an airport and well let's just say things will never be the same! Russ is an ex-military man, all Alpha and appealing and sexy and irresistible. He is visiting Penny's sleepy little town for just a few days but finds Penny sweet, sexy and just his type. 
 ""All I'm doing is negotiating. You've got something I want, and I plan to get it...Penny Darling."" But I don't say it like a name. I say it like I mean it. Penny, darling. 
 Half the fun of reading this book is Penny's HILARIOUS inner monologue. Good Lord, this Russ is a man who knows what he wants and isn't shy about going after it! Penny quickly falls under his spell but Russ is keeping a secret from Penny. 
 Russ really is a good man, and he quickly falls for Penny. He lives in Boston but begins to fall in love with Penny's quirky small Florida town of Port Flamingo. I love the small-town romance trope but for me, some of the zany shenanigans here overshadowed the smoking hot relationship between Penny and Russ. I could not get enough of the scenes between these two!! 
 ""I won't hurt you until you tell me I can."" She gasps into her arm. ""Where did you learn to talk like that?"" ""Not learned. It's part of the package."" ""I like the package,"" she says, as I position myself at her opening. ""You don't know the package."" 
 The steamy-hot romance, the humor, the dialogue...all of this added up to a winner for me. The author must have a terrific sense of humor because it really shines through in her writing. Penny is a very relatable heroine, warm, loyal, down-to-earth and FUNNY. She knows she is falling fast for Russ but these two are clearly meant for each other. Russ is simply irresistible and makes it easy for Penny to fall in love with him. 
 ""Here lies Penelope Darling, who died of a swoon."" 
 Bravo to Ms. Rendell for writing a very adult, very explicit erotic romantic comedy. 'Just Like That' is a perfect book if you are looking for a swoony, SEXY and very, very hot read with two very relatable main characters. Loved the Epilogue and I'm really looking forward to more books from this incredibly talented author.

"4.5 - 5 GORGEOUS STARS 
 ""No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine."" 
 Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! 
 Called a contemporary romance ""with paranormal elements,"" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! 
 Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. 
 ""But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more."" 
 What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! 
 ""Nikolai Alexei,"" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. ""Who are you?"" 
 There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! 
 ""Love and hope,"" she said. ""That's life to me.""

"4.5 - 5 Stars!!! 
 ""You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are."" 
 Run, don't walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata's writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can't get enough!! 
 I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She's driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team's assistant coaches. 
 I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I'd grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. 
 Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. 
 To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she'd been around once. 
 Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn't trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. 
 This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata's writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn't even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! 
 ""I used to have a huge crush on you."" 
 The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn't like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there'd been posters of him all over my wall. Or that 'Sal loves Kulti' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. 
 ""Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then."" 
 Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it's cracked up to be and that Kulti really can't lead a 'normal' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. 
 I'm not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn't like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. 
 This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read!

"4.5 Stars 
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, 'American Prince' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry's story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. 
 ""I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble."" 
 Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! 
 ""And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband's heart in his hands and he doesn't even know it. He's too busy looking at the details of Ash's faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is."" 
 One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone's great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there's plenty of time to read this series before 'American King' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!! 
 ""I'm done running from you,"" I said honestly. ""I tried and it didn't matter--you haunted me everywhere I went."" 
 ""And you haunted me,"" he murmured, rolling over to press his lips against mine once more. ""My little prince.""

"OMG!! This book was both hilarious AND hot!! I have read many office romances but 'Tempt the Boss' is one of my favorites. Modern, sexy, and very funny, Natasha Madison is an author to watch! I loved Lauren and Austin's sexy, witty, sarcastic banter. This book was pure FUN and a fantastic escapist read. 
 Lauren has to re-enter the workforce after the sudden break-up of her marriage. Enter her beast of a boss, who can't seem to keep an assistant for more than a few days at a time. Difficult, demanding and sarcastic, Austin is just plain horrible!! 
 ""When I ask you to get me coffee, I'm not asking you to join me for a cup. When I tell you to scan and email something, I don't need reporting of the task as if you're waiting for a sticker on your paper. When you have a caller on hold, I don't need you announcing them to me through the intercom in a singsong voice. I also don't need you knocking on my door every few minutes to ask me if I need anything. Trust me, when I need something, you'll be the first one to know."" 
 Lauren holds her own, though, and refuses to quit. She's smart, tough and gets even with Austin for his outrageous behavior. Let the games commence! Once these two start playing pranks on each other, hilarity ensues. This story is funny, fast-paced, H-A-W-T but has lots of heart and sweetness underneath all the wit. Once these two get together, watch out!! 
 ""I can only be a gentleman for so long, baby,"" I whisper roughly in her ear and then roll the lobe between my lips. Her head falls back, hitting the wall. 
 BUT...Austin lives by his own set of rules and one of them is that he never, ever dates anyone from his office. Even though he and Lauren have an undeniable connection, he wants to her to quit so that they can continue to see each other. Lauren refuses to give in, even when Austin makes it almost impossible for to stay! 
 ""He wants me to quit. Well, fuck that! I'm going to make him regret he made this stupid rule, even if I give myself blue balls, or a blue vagina, or whatever."" 
 This the first book I have read by Natasha Madison and I loved it! She has a gift for writing sexy banter and I absolutely loved the way Lauren held her own as a single mom. Her children are an integral part of this story and the ending was perfect for these two characters. This story had heat, heart and tons of sexy times. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Austin's point of view was PERFECT. If you're a fan of Emma Chase, you will LOVE Natasha Madison!

"4.5 Memorable Stars!!! 
 I am not sure how to categorize this beautiful and unforgettable story but Mara White really shows her writing skills with 'Touched'. This is not so much a romance as a coming of age story, BUT there is romance and love in this beautiful story. The cover is a perfect rendition of the story inside: ethereal, tempestuous and achingly beautiful. 
 ""Her sister was made exactly how she was supposed to be. Untouchable."" 
 This is the story of two sisters who grew up in abject poverty. But the author doesn't write them as pitiful characters; instead they are resourceful, industrious and most of all, survivors. They suffer through an absolutely brutal childhood which leaves June damaged and unable to be touched by anyone. But there is most definitely lots of love and devotion in this story. The sisters cross paths with Alaric and there are many tender moments between the sisters and their new young friend. 
 ""June was a free bird; no cages could withstand her. Escape or die trying."" 
 I read this story in mid-Summer, before the advent of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. So the story is especially relevant now, as it deals with the terrible impact of Hurricane Katrina on the citizens of Louisiana. 
 I realize this review is vague but this is an epic story that spans years and locations and jumps back and forth in time. I can't really write any more detail without spoiling the plot. And the ending!! This is Mara White's BEST book yet and should not be missed. If you are up for an epic story with love and suffering and beauty and multi-dimensional characters, then read 'Touched'. You won't soon forget it!

"""How did it come to this? How did we get here? How will it end?"" 
 What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. 
 ""Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different."" 
 The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. 
 The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. 
 ""The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it."" 
 We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to ""chase"" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. 
 They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear ""off the grid"" so that she would never find them again. 
 This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? 
 ""Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?"" 
 This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away ""eclipse chasing"" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!",6,5,1,516,50.26,65.21,65.72,7.85,13.58,19.19,86.43,70.35,58.53,12.98,7.36,1.74,0.58,0.58,2.33,1.74,5.62,15.31,8.53,0.97,13.57,9.11,7.17,9.11,0.19,15.5,5.04,3.49,4.07,1.94,0.19,1.94,11.63,0.97,10.66,3.1,1.74,1.16,1.55,0.78,2.91,0.19,5.23,1.74,3.1,2.71,0.78,1.55,0.58,0.19,0.19,0.0,12.79,5.04,0.39,0.0,1.36,0.58,1.55,7.95,0.97,0.19,1.94,1.16,0.19,0.19,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.19,0.0,1.74,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.58,0.39,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.0,1.16,3.29,9.69,0.39,1.55,6.59,1.16,0.0,0.19,7.95,6.4,5.23,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.09,5.43,3.29,1.16,0.97,1.36,3.88,0
"Smart and sexy and delicious! I devoured this one. LOVE Ryder!!!! 
 This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although 'Sweet Rivalry' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in 'Sweet Cheeks' as Saylor's brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. 
 Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? 
 ""Beard burn is a real thing. 
 And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. "" 
 I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg's books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then 'Sweet Rivalry' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn't longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday!

"""I have always burned for you. I will always burn for you. You own me like no one ever has, or ever will."" 
 Looking for an escapist read that will enthrall you for a few hours? Then 'Nova' is for you. A fast-paced, YA story set in exotic locales all over the world, Landon and Rachel's story is fun, a little emotional, sexy and very enjoyable. Rebecca Yarros is a terrific writer and has created characters that seem very relatable and very real. 
 Landon and Rachel had a very intense love but he left her behind to go off in search of adventure with the Renegades. He does intense stunts all over the world and has fans everywhere he goes. Both Landon and Rachel are now on the same Study at Sea program, he is shocked but wants to do everything in his power to try and win her back. 
 They have fantastic chemistry but Rachel is broken-hearted. I loved these two together, the way Rachel stood up for herself was very refreshing and I enjoyed the globe-trotting aspect of this story. The deep friendships between all the characters form a big part of this book and I loved how supportive each friend was. This is a lovely second-chance romance with tons of action and sweet emotion thrown in the mix. And the cover! I love a sexy, eye-catching cover. It perfectly captures the spirit and the feel of Nova.",5,4,1,240,58.42,62.31,31.19,99.0,14.12,16.25,86.67,72.08,58.33,12.92,9.17,2.92,0.0,2.5,3.33,0.42,3.75,16.25,8.75,0.42,12.08,8.33,5.42,7.5,0.42,13.33,7.92,4.58,4.17,1.67,1.67,0.83,10.0,4.58,5.42,1.25,0.42,0.83,0.83,0.83,2.5,0.0,10.42,8.33,0.83,5.42,3.75,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,10.42,3.75,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.25,7.08,0.0,0.42,1.25,2.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.08,0.42,0.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.42,2.5,5.42,12.5,1.67,2.08,7.92,1.25,0.0,0.42,2.92,4.17,6.25,1.67,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.58,6.25,3.33,0.42,0.42,1.25,2.92,0
"Loved!! Sexy and refreshingly funny. I heard so much about this book and picked it up when I was craving something different and light. Sort of a book within a book, 44 Chapters is in the form of a journal written by a wife and mother who is experiencing something of a lull in her marriage. She was a tattooed wild child who ended up married to an accountant! How did that happen?! 
 ""It's a beautiful life Ken has given me, one filled with security and laughter and intelligent conversation and honeymoons in Paris and well-behaved children with long attention spans and cute noses and his-and-hers sinks and 401(k)s and well-manicured lawns. I just wish the orgasms matched the drapes, if you know what I mean."" 
 BB adores her husband Ken but things have gotten a little .... quiet. BB discovers that Ken may have secretly read parts of her journal, and when he does, things get MUCH spicier and hotter between them. Thrilled with Ken's newfound interest in sex, BB decides to embellish the stories of her past boyfriends. The writing is absolutely charming and hilarious, written as if BB was talking to a best friend. I was really hoping for Ken to wake up and take an interest in his marriage because it was obvious they had amazing chemistry together. 
 What he does have is a Captain America-style square jaw with a subtle cleft and a permanent five o'clock shadow. He also has enviously high cheekbones. His aqua-blue eyes are hooded by long espresso-colored lashes, and his sandy-brown hair is just long enough on top to allow for a good grip. His physique is lean yet muscular. His sense of humor is dry. He is brilliant and self-deprecating, and he has the ability to skip rocks across any body of water (a secret turn-on of mine). 
 This book is best enjoyed with glass or two of wine. I can't believe this is BB Easton's debut book! Each of her past boyfriends was charming, dangerous, sweet and sexy in their own way. I loved the descriptions of teenage first love and the '80s references were priceless. BB Easton is nothing if not brutally honest. Her descriptions of married life and babies are spot-on. Everyone can relate to this story! BB spends much of the book hoping that her straight-laced husband will get her name visibly tattooed somewhere on his body. And she just wants him to be a little more aggressive. She doesn't think she is asking for too much! 
 I want to take him with me everywhere. I want us to live a hundred years and die at the same time. I want them to mix our cremated remains together, dump us into a river, and watch our mingled ashes swirl like coffee creamer all the way to the ocean. I want our souls (okay, my soul and his, whatever he has, operating system?) to find each other on the other side as soon as possible just so that we can fall in love and make more babies and do it all over again. I just also want him to f*ck my brains out. 
 This is a very funny book, written with great sensitivity and a sharp eye for detail. BB Easton has already written the next book in this series which is about her boyfriend Knight. What a character!! I can't wait to read his story, 'Skin.' I was pleasantly surprised by this wild and crazy story! After reading this, I feel like BB Easton is an old friend. I love her writing style!

"4.5 Stars!!! 
 Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! 
 ""You can't fix me you know..."" 
 Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she's done it again with 'Most of All You.' Gabriel and Crystal's story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. 
 ""He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... 
 This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal's new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. 
 ""I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life."" 
 While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. 
 ""Choice is such a loaded word, isn't it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past."" 
 This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal's story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I'm glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. 
 ""I wasn't a victim. I was a survivor..."" 
 Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don't want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton!

"I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. 
 The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. 
 ""There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star."" 
 Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the ""Kelley Trio"" - yes, Officer Kelley! 
 Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! 
 ""Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot."" Oh my God. I didn't just say that. 
 But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. ""A cop! I meant a cop."" 
 This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor.

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 This is definitely a case of it's not you, it's me. So many readers adore this story!! And I am a HUGE fan of Pepper Winters. First of all, this cover is absolutely stunning. I would read this book based on the cover alone. And I love the chemistry between the two MC's in this story. And as usual, Pepper creates a strong-willed, kick-ass heroine who is smart, driven and beautiful. 
 The story is promising: Elle is assaulted as a young teenager by a gang of thugs in New York and is rescued by a mysterious stranger. Sadly, she never sees his face and can't help him as he is carted off by the police that night. But she never forgets the man who saved her life and with whom she spent a few very memorable hours. 
 Fast forward years later and Elle is the head of a large retail company. She is single but her father tries to fix her up with nearly every eligible bachelor he meets. But when Elle and Penn meet, she is taken by his dark good looks and dominating personality. 
 Fierce eyebrows gave expression and authority to the intensity of his dark brown eyes. Dark hair bordering on black curled around his cheeks, forehead, and ears, speaking of wildness rather than tamed. His strong nose and refined cheekbones were perfect adornments to the beard bordering his lips. 
 Penn is dangerous, for sure, but nevertheless alluring to the sheltered Elle. She hasn't had much real-world experience and she finds Penn incredibly sexy. 
 I narrowed my eyes. ""What do you want from me?"" 
 He smiled, his mouth once again bewitching me. ""Not sure yet."" 
 Who is Penn? Can he be trusted? He quite literally sweeps Elle off her feet. Set against the backdrop of New York City, this darkly sexy story is classic Pepper Winters. Everyone has secrets and nothing is at it seems. 
 Pulling away, he rested his forehead on mine, a roguish smile replacing his grimace. ""I'm not letting you go. I've only just found you."" 
 Some of the plot points of the story fell a little flat for me and took me out of the story. Other readers seem to overlook these issues so if you are a fan of dark romance, then give this one a go!

"""No matter what happens, even on your worst day, find something to be grateful about. It'll make you feel better."" 
 What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful, it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real, very human, funny, flawed and just very authentic. 
 Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City, having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay, She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it ""more heart."" She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. 
 ""One person alone against winter was rough. But two people, together... Together. A word I never used."" 
 Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment, temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly, they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. 
 ""...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had."" 
 A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the ""extras"" in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story. 
 ""You are my home, baby,"" he said. ""I never want to be anywhere else.""

"4 1/2 Stars!! 
 What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. 
 ""Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me."" 
 My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. 
 The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. 
 ""Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed."" 
 Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. 
 ""Thank you, Preston."" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. 
 Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around. 
 ""Or actually, maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start. Tonight. This is our beginning, Annalia.""",15,5,1,427,35.26,51.23,37.69,60.72,9.09,21.08,87.82,66.04,55.5,13.82,9.6,3.98,0.7,0.23,3.75,0.7,4.22,15.69,4.68,1.87,12.18,9.13,6.56,7.03,1.87,14.99,6.09,4.92,5.39,2.81,1.17,1.41,10.07,2.58,7.26,2.58,0.23,0.47,1.41,0.94,2.11,0.0,10.54,6.56,3.98,4.45,2.58,1.87,0.0,0.23,0.94,0.0,14.05,4.68,1.41,0.23,0.47,0.7,0.7,8.9,1.17,0.0,4.92,0.94,0.47,0.0,0.47,0.0,2.81,0.23,0.0,1.64,0.47,0.47,1.87,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.17,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.47,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.0,4.68,10.77,0.23,1.41,5.85,1.17,0.47,1.87,4.68,5.85,3.51,1.41,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,22.01,10.3,4.68,0.47,1.87,1.64,3.04,0
"""I want to own every inch of your skin, to be the only man who touches you, who tastes you. You think I wouldn't bid on a woman? That I shouldn't bid on you, of all people? I'll spend every cent I have, break every goddamn law to keep you."" 
 The second book of the Endgame series begins right were 'The Pawn' ended. Avery has really hit rock bottom. She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and 'The Knight' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. 
 Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren's writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here, he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father's downfall. Make no mistake, Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure, and he still remains mysterious. 
 I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery's mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. 'The Knight' ends on a surprising note and I can't wait to read 'The Castle,' the third book in this series. 
 Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark, very sensual and dangerous.

"""Some of the best times in life come from bad ideas."" 
 Sometimes you need a good old-fashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book! Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny, sexy, tender-hearted romance that is creative, engaging and sweet. 
 I enjoyed every minute of this book. Emerie and Drew ""meet cute"" and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland's romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew, an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe, for very good reason. I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!! This book is literally laugh-out-loud funny. 
 ""And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them."" 
 ""Damn straight. I'm like a superhero. The Prolactinator."" 
 Egomaniac is a super-sexy, very fast-paced read that has lots of warmth and heart. It is witty and smart and very addicting. I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author.

"""Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary."" 
 A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. 
 The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. 
 Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. 
 Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. 
 ""That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?"" 
 The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. 
 The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then ""The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

"4.5 Amazing Stars!! 
 When a trusted author friend recommended this book to me, I immediately downloaded it and dove right in. Wait, I thought, this book is how long??! 'Juniper Smoke' is an odyssey, a fantastic, sexy, funny, smart and heart-stopping journey that I never wanted to end. 
 ""I, Juniper Mills, always run away from the people I love. It is the story and sequel of my life."" 
 There is just so much to love about this book that I want to yell from the rooftops for everyone to read it! Juniper might be one of the sassiest, wittiest and smartest heroines I have read in a long time. She is simply a breath of fresh air. And Kyle Paxton, OMG KYLE!! Where do I even begin. In a sea of billionaire bachelors and dark heroes, he is a standout. I will never forget him. Poor, wealthy, lonely Kyle. Forget everything you know about reading contemporary romance novels because Sadia Ash just threw it all out the window. Her characters are fresh, damaged, strong, lonely and smart. 
 ""Will you please leave? And stop looking up."" 
 ""Give me a reason to stop looking up."" 
 Great. A Comedy Central reject. ""Are you one of the waiters?"" 
 ""Hmm. Telekinesis. I think I've found my soul mate."" 
 There is so much to say about this book. The basics are that Juniper (yes, named after the tree) is a junior curator at a museum in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Kyle Paxton is a wealthy investor who founded a tech start-up company at a very young age. He is sexy and gorgeous and geeky and does not have normal relationships with women. But Juniper is basically a goner from the minute they meet. 
 ""He laughed and it was a pleasant deep-throated sound. He held me so close, it vibrated in my body. Wow. If I could record and harness Kyle's remarkable laugh all the world's babies would stop crying and maybe the adults would be moved to work for peace. I felt happiness I had never known before. Then I got sad, for very soon I would never see this hot and mysterious stranger again."" 
 Lonely Juniper has been raised by a single mother who has had a hard life and so taught Juniper that men and relationships were to be avoided. So she finds herself unable to connect with men at the ripe old age of 26. Friends, yes, a great job, yes, but this geeky girl runs in the other direction where men are concerned. 
 See, I was raised to hate men. My mother didn't raise me to believe in fairytales. Only unfairy tales. 
 Kyle is as smitten with Juniper as she is with him. But this delicious, slow-burn romance takes its time with the characters and the story and by the time these two get together, I was addicted to their story. 
 Okay, there it was. I was outed in my mind. I want Kyle Paxton. And getting him was as easy as collecting the Pacific Ocean in a teacup. I was screwed. 
 Sadia Ash's writing is sharp, biting, funny and verrrrry sexy. In fact, the only complaint I have about 'Juniper Smoke' is that it ended! I even liked Kyle, although at many times he came across as cold and calculating. It was part of his charm but he did frustrate me at times. 
 His expression grew distant again. ""No. I've already said too much. Don't read too much into it, Juniper. I make my decisions on human capital quickly. When I meet people, I know at once if I want to work with them and if I want to be with them."" 
 There is a LOT to absorb in this book but I absolutely loved the how the settings changed, from frosty Michigan to California and back again. Every chapter was richly drawn and seemed vital to the story. The connection between Juniper and Kyle was as breathtaking as it was tinged with sadness. I really felt the emotional connection between the characters here and the author made them come alive for me. 
 A lump formed in my throat, for despite the blank way he spoke, I felt the ache in his voice, the loneliness in his words, and the vulnerability in his eyes. I had never seen him falter from his alpha-male facade at any time, and so this fragmented man in front of me was fascinating. Intriguing. Complex. Just my type. Danger bells again. 
 The story was creative and unexpected and surprised me at every turn. It is filled with people, places and things that all have meaning. I was completely taken aback at the ending and cannot wait until the next part of Juniper and Kyle's story comes out! I will read anything that Sadia Ash writes. If you are looking for a book that is far and away different from any other romance out there, then read 'Juniper Smoke' and prepare to fall in love with these characters!

"3.5 Stars 
 'Bombshell' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. 
 I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. 
 The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!

 ""If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?"" 
 OMG!! Intelligent and thrilling page-turner that I read in almost one sitting! The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. 
 I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. 
 The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. What is happening to Cass? 
 Cass's mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. 
 I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!!

"What an outstanding debut!! Sexy and intense and messy. If you're expecting a hearts and flowers romance, then find another book! James and Madison's painful story completely captivated me. 
 A War Like Ours is a compelling, gritty and enthralling book. Once I started I could not put it down! I love stories where the main protagonists are imperfect characters. James and Madison make poor choices in their lives, but somehow the author makes it all seem very believable and just plain real. Also: there is no insta-love here so if you like a story that takes some time to build, then you will love A War Like Ours. 
 ""Let the pain take over. Let it own you, turn you inside out. Let it win, Madison."" 
 James Maxwell is harboring a big secret. A life-altering, painful secret. He is a brilliant cancer researcher but is not handling his personal life very well at all. He has a beautiful young daughter but he is keeping something from her that is getting more difficult to withhold with the each passing day. As much as I did not agree with James, I totally understood his pain and grief thanks to Saffron Kent's incredible writing. Lonely and tortured, he seeks out Madison, a staff member at the summer resort where he is staying. Somehow he sees a kindred spirit in her. 
 Madison is bitter and depressed. She is stuck in a relationship for all the wrong reasons. For some reason she is drawn to James. But their relationship is fiery, explosive and not at all peaceful. Madion has a deep-seated hatred for men but yet she feels something - sympathy? lust? - for the very sexy and emotionally unavailable James. 
 This story is raw and explicit and very emotional. I could not wait to see if James and Madison got the happy ending they so desperately deserved. All the characters in this book are very flawed and very unusual. I was blown away by this debut book by Saffron Kent and can't wait to read more from this very talented writer. 
 ""A beating heart doesn't mean that I'm alive.""

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 I adore Jane Harvey-Berrick and her books are among my favorites. This story is a lovely, sexy romance with a good dose of old-fashioned angst thrown in. I liked the way the author exposed the horrific realities of dog-fighting so kudos to her for that. There was obviously lots of research that went into this book. Also loved that the heroine was a veterinarian. There is a good amount of steam in this book and the story makes for a wonderful afternoon or evening of reading.

"""Mack was the only one for me. There was no way this feeling could ever be replicated...because it had been years in the making."" 
 Penelope Ward is an auto-buy author for me. Hands down, her second-chance romances are among my absolute favorite stories! Her main characters always have tons of heart, soul and chemistry, And humor! And I adore the catchy title of this book. 
 Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankie's class in Boston. Mack has broken up with his son's mother, with whom he had a long-term relationship. Mack and Frankie were roommates years before, with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack. But they were not meant to be, and went their separate ways. 
 Now Mack has shown up, determined to win Frankie back. She is the love of his life. The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend, an older, very stable college professor who adores her. What will Frankie do? Told in alternating POV's, we read how Mack and Frankie's love blossomed several years before. They are simply meant to be. 
 ""Remember all those things you wished I could do to you? I'm about to make all your wishes come true if you let me."" 
 All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF. Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book! But at its heart it is a gorgeous second-chance romance as only Ms. Ward can write. 
 Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot. I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Mack's son Jonah. I also adored Frankie's boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack, the love of her life, and her current boyfriend. Ms. Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity. This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once. Overall a lovely, emotional and sexxxxxy story with lots of heat and heart!!

"Dawn makes a sound. If you listen closely, right as the sun starts to come up, you'll hear it. It's like the echo of birth: silence, followed by a gentle push, followed by moans, then the sloppy deluge of new life. On good days I like it because it reminds me that I'm alive. On bad days it makes me feel like dust. 
 Can you believe that writing? I read this book as part of my New Year's resolution to go through my Kindle and read some of the many, many books already there. And I picked a winner. Sadly, it doesn't seem like this is available in ebook format right now but I hope that changes soon. 
 Yes, I know, I am very late to the party on this one. But GSH has now made it onto my list of favorite books ever. I had heard so much about this book and it lived up to every word of hype. I fell in love with Jacob Grace and want to be best friends with Beatrice! 
 ""Something about being with him made me warm, like I was sitting in front of a fireplace whose embers were barely flickering, yet still giving off heat. It made me feel safe."" 
 Beatrice is a lonely artist living in the vast wasteland called Los Angeles and meets a kindred soul in Jacob, a writer. They are both funny, sad, loyal and both seeking the perfect soul mate. This book is at times hilarious, poignant, tragic and uplifting. The description of life in L.A. is priceless. 
 She tossed her hair around when she laughed like the glamorous android slut monster I knew she was. Jacob would never give the time of day to a girl like her, I told myself. Be that as it may, I focused on the ceiling panel above her head. I tried to will it loose. I wanted it to crash down and squash her like a villain in a cartoon. And I'm a pacifist. 
 This book is a journey and although I could tell where the story was ultimately going, it was absolutely breathtaking. The author has a true gift of words. Her characters were vivid, real, funny and very flawed. I can't wait to read 'How to Kill a Rock Star' and experience more of her talent for storytelling. 
 ""That's why I love you. Because you say ridiculous fucking things like that. Normal people don't say things like that, Jacob. All my life I waited for someone who would say things like that to me. And for someone I didn't feel alone in the presence of. Someone who understood. Someone who would make me feel like it wasn't just me against the world. Even when we're not together."" 
 The author has lots to say about love, sex, friendship, forgiveness and the bonds of family. This book resonated with me on many different levels. Read this book!! It might change your life!! And the cover is absolutely perfect for the story. I highlighted a ton of passages in this book and it is very difficult to pick a favorite but I loved this one: 
 ""We're all searching for something to fill up what I like to call that big, God-shaped hole in our souls. Some people use alcohol, or sex, or their children, or food, or money, or music, or heroin. A lot of people even use the concept of God itself. I could go on and on. I used to know a girl who used shoes. She had over two-hundred pairs. But it's all the same thing, really. People, for some stupid reason, think they can escape their sorrows.""

"CD Reiss is one of my favorite romance authors. Her writing is mature, sexy, nuanced and never fails to grab me. And I do love books about marriage. Separation Games was a perfect conclusion to the first book in this series. Marriage Games ended with an unusual twist and I absolutely loved how the author worked things out between Adam and Diana. I feel both of their pain, confusion and longing. 
 And Adam, OMG! He was one of the author's most memorable heroes. Wow. Both Diana and Adam are mature, smart and very driven. This book is off-the-charts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist. 
 ""Beg to come."" 
 ""Please."" 
 ""Beg harder."" 
 Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues, it is explosive. I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didn't love, and this duet is no exception. The supporting characters are all very well-written and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story. The Epilogue is fantastic! I was actually sorry to see this story end. Highly recommend this steamy, emotional and very mature erotic romance.

"""I know precisely the kind of woman you are, Daisy. And if you don't understand it, then it'll be up to me to show it to you."" 
 YASS!! If you need a Kristen Ashley fix, do NOT miss Marcus and Daisy's novella!! Pure goodness and beauty. 
 If you're a fan of the Rock Chick series (and let's face it, who isn't??), Daisy has been a constant. Such a character! But without a doubt a sweetheart. Her story has been a long time coming and it hit all the hight notes. Only Kristen Ashley can make a novella feel as satisfying as a full-length novel. Marcus and Daisy are pure KA gold. All of the wonderful writing, emotion, plot and LOVE that you expect from Kristen Ashley are here. And kudos to the author for tackling a very sensitive subject and handling it perfectly. If you need a hit of Kristen Ashley, 'Rock Chick Reawakening' is your answer. It's everything you expect from the Queen of Alphas and much more.

"This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult, very erotic, very explicit romance that I really fell for. 
 The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. 
 Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. 
 This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book. 
 Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure. 
 ""I don't want you to touch me like Weston,"" I said, once and for all. ""I don't want Weston! I want you!"" 
 Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. ""I know. I was waiting for you to know too."" 
 Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. 
 Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win. 
 I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!! 
 ""Were you even going to say goodbye?"" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all. 
 He smiled lazily. ""I don't know what you mean. I'm still here."" 
 ""You're just as much already gone."" 
 His face was in the shadows, but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn't see it. ""I'm less gone than you'd imagine.""

"4.5 Hotter-Than-Hell Stars!! 
 ""This was supposed to be my fairy tale, with me as the princess and Ash as the prince, but there's a third person here, a person we both want and who wants both of us."" 
 OMG I floved this book!! Can't wait to read 'American Prince. ' 
 Those were my very first thoughts after finishing this book. It was sitting on my Kindle for a long time and I'll admit I kept looking at it, thinking, ""What is this? Queen? Another royalty book? What?"" BUT once I started I couldn't stop! Ash, Embry and Greer's story is sizzling, stormy, loving, everlasting and completely gripping. 
 ""All the words that men use about women--enchanted, charmed, addicted--they don't even begin to cover what I felt for you and your handful of shattered glass. I thought about you that night, and the next and the next, and when I was deployed to Carpathia, you were all I thought about. I built these fantasies in my mind where I would come home after the war and find you at whatever university you were at. I would kiss you until you were like you were that night at the party, begging me to do whatever I wanted."" 
 Oh Ash, you sweet-talker you! This is a story of three intertwined lives and their rise to the top of American politics. Since 'Priest' by Sierra Simone is one of my favorite erotica books, I knew that I would love this one. I just wasn't prepared for the level of hotness and (slight) depravity! And I mean that in the nicest way. 
 I rarely have time to read a series back to back but I did just that with 'American Queen' and 'American Prince.' The books are just that good!! There are villains and back-stabbers and war and bravery and lots and lots of sex. And I mean TONS. And a good, not-so-old-fashioned love story. 
 ""I fell in love with Ash, only to watch him marry another woman. I slept with a different man, only to never hear from him again."" 
 Ash and Embry are war heroes who are now the President and Vice-President of United States, respectively. Their love for each other and for Greer unfolds through alternating points of view and flashbacks between the past and the present. This is a very clever tale filled with references to the story of King Arthur and Camelot but also THE hottest and most passionate love scenes I've ever read. Ash, Embry and Greer are all perfect for each other but will they find some kind of happily ever after? I loved the conclusion to this book and I can say that the next one was just as enticing. If you are looking for something spicy and intelligent and gripping, then you will absolutely adore 'American Queen'!

"4.5 - 5 Stars!! 
 ""It's always the ones who are the quietest who often have the greatest things to say. And yes, I think we'll be friends."" 
 Simple, beautiful and unforgettable, 'Wolfsong' was one of the most gripping books I've read all year. Never in a million years did I think I would love a book about werewolves with a little fantasy sprinkled in but this book and this writing is just gorgeous. If you want to take a chance an read something that is a little outside your comfort zone, read this book!! I will never forget the great Ox and the entire Bennett family. 
 A story about love, devotion, loyalty, friendship and family, 'Wolfsong' was also one of the most stunning love stories I've ever read. Ox, a kind, lovely soul, lives in a small town and lives a very quiet life with his mother. Until he meets Joe, and then his whole world is turned upside down. 
 ""Words. Words were my enemy. How to say that here was where I felt the safest. Here was where I felt most at home. Here was where I wouldn't be judged. I wasn't a fucking retard here. I wasn't a waste of space or time. I wanted to say so much, too much, and found I couldn't really say anything at all."" 
 I highlighted so much of this epic story that my entire review could be made of quotes from this extraordinary book! Every character, every scene felt necessary and breathtaking. The bonds between Ox, Joe and the Bennett family seemed unbreakable and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this amazing author would take, me. This book is quite a journey and I loved every single minute. 
 ""It was not a gradual thing. Wait. That was a lie. I didn't know it was a gradual thing. But it must have been. It had to have been. Because it's the only thing that explained the cosmic explosion that was the feeling of want and need and mine mine mine. The force of it was ridiculous. It had to have been there. For a long time."" 
 Fantasy books are usually not my thing but this book completely grabbed me from the first page. I felt as if I knew each of these characters. I wanted to wrap my arms around Ox and give him a big hug. These characters literally came to life before my eyes! I became entranced by the Oregon setting and the Bennett clan. I only wanted Ox and Joe to have their happy ending because they both deserved it so, so much. 
 ""I would do anything to make you happy because no one had ever smelled like you did. It was candy canes and pinecones. It was epic and awesome. And it was home. You smelled like my home, Ox."" 
 I don't want to go into detail about the plot because it was surprising and thrilling. Take a chance on 'Wolfsong' and read this book! It was simply glorious. Definitely one of those books that would make a fantastic movie. 
 ""It's easy to get lost, Ox, because the world is a wide and scary place. And every now and then, you just have to be reminded of the way home.""",12,5,1,547,17.86,12.87,49.85,76.88,11.16,13.16,91.77,76.97,61.79,17.18,9.32,6.58,0.18,1.1,0.73,0.37,7.86,17.37,7.68,1.46,9.32,11.15,6.95,8.41,2.01,20.84,7.68,5.85,1.83,1.46,0.0,0.37,15.36,2.93,12.43,2.56,1.83,3.11,2.56,1.28,2.19,0.37,7.13,5.12,1.46,2.74,2.19,0.18,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.37,8.41,4.39,0.37,0.0,0.18,0.55,1.83,4.02,0.18,0.37,0.18,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.66,0.55,0.73,2.01,0.18,0.18,1.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.0,1.46,1.1,0.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.0,7.31,9.51,0.37,0.91,6.58,0.37,0.55,1.28,3.11,9.51,3.11,0.73,0.18,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.0,18.83,8.23,4.02,0.0,1.28,3.29,2.01,0
"4.5 - 5 Stars!! 
 ""Just like I tell the boys, we don't play for one single run, we play to win the whole game. And I'm in it to win it."" 
 Mariana Zapata, where have you been all my life!? 'Wait for It' was completely engrossing; a slow-burn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again. And now I must decide which one of her books to read next! This was my first book by this amazing author, and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story! 
 'Wait for It' is not a predictable story. It is a solid, real, passionate romance, filled with heart and humor and heart-stopping love. Diana is single and raising two young boys. She is independent, funny, hard-working and definitely NOT looking for romance. 
 She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way, and they actually get off to a very rocky start. Dallas is stern, uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL. 
 What were you supposed to do when someone didn't want to be your friend or at least be friendly, and you'd tried your best? I thought I'd been a pretty good person. A pretty good neighbor. I hadn't done anything to make him feel uncomfortable. At least, I genuinely didn't think I had. 
 Diana oh-so-slowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boy's baseball team. Between baseball and being neighbors, Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story. 
 He has a soft spot for single moms. You are no one special, Diana, I reminded myself. You are no one special. 
 Mariana Zapata's writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next. I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana! The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real. The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly. No insta-love here, folks. This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful. 
 'Wait for It"" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn't that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book. It is gorgeous.

"This story had so much promise! And I love Whitney G.'s writing style; in fact, Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year.

"""I swear. Give me one more chance and I will make the most of it."" 
 Reading this book made me a better person. I can't find the right words to describe this magnificent story! I'm not eloquent enough. I want to be Suanne Laquer's best friend. Read this book. It will change your life. Very few authors have a way with words like Suanne Laquer. She reaches in and grabs your heart and doesn't let go. 
 ""I think love is a big wisdom made up of small understandings."" 
 This book tells the interwoven tale of several main characters. Geno and Carlos were twins and enjoyed an unbreakable bond as many twins do. Fairly early on in the story, Geno is subject to the most awful kind of abuse which would have broken most people. And for a while, it seems as though Geno will never recover from his terrible ordeal. Geno copes with the agony of his assault by turning to an alter-ego that was based on his twin brother Carlos. 
 ""Carlos was Los. Geronimo was Mos. Los and Mos lived in the starry world of Nos, Spanish for we. Nos rhymed with dos, Spanish for two."" 
 Geno was a gorgeous soul who was turned into an empty shell by acts of pure evil. I could not imagine how he would ever climb out of the black hole of despair that he was in. But this is ultimately a tale of hope and beauty, even though the author does not shy away from a difficult, agonizing and painful subject. My heart broke for Geno and his family. 
 Steffen Finch is an art therapist who seems to be the only person who can get through to Geno. At the same time, Stef and Javier Landes begin a relationship together that can only be described as pure bliss. And just in case you think this book is only filled with treacherous story lines and complete tragedy, it is not! Suanne Laquer is very funny and she works in many lighthearted moments. This book is very much like real life, mixing in the gritty moments with the funny ones. 
 ""Hi,"" Jav said. 
 ""Hi. If I kiss you outside my mother's bedroom, I'm going to need therapy."" 
 ""How about the closet?"" 
 And so, Stef, Javier and Geno's stories slowly become intertwined as Stef begins to treat Geno with art therapy. We get to experience the healing process as well as the gorgeous blossoming relationship between Stef and Javier. Everything in this book unfolds with perfect timing, and nothing is ever rushed or forced. Even after finishing this book months ago, I still feel as though all of the characters were real. And that is quite a feat for an author to accomplish. At the risk of rambling on and on, I will also say that I highlighted huge portions of this book. And that I LOVED all of the supporting characters. 
 The chemistry between Stef and Jav was absolutely off the charts. They both had insecurities going into their relationship which made them both all the more believable. This felt like a genuine partnership. No insta-love, but instead a rich and nuanced passion for each other. 
 ""Tonight their bedroom overflowed with magnificent sex. Death by sex. Grandiose, over-the-top sex. They were making love like architects of the universe. Fucking like mathematicians. Multiplying, dividing, canceling each other out and starting from zero. 
 I am simply in awe of Suanne Laquer. This book is breathtaking! Although it can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend you first read 'An Exaltation of Larks' - which is only 99 cents at the time of this review. If you only read a few books a year, make 'A Charm of Finches' one of them. Filled with rich imagery, passion and pure emotion, it is unforgettable. 
 ""I want this feeling I have with him. When I'm around him I feel honest. I feel authentic. I feel myself and I see so clearly who I want to be and the life I want to lead. And the kind of person I want to have with me on the ride. A curator and sailor. A person who makes me feel like this. I want to be who I am when I'm with him.

"Love the Reapers books so I was excited to read this when it released as part of the 1001 Dark Nights series. Joanna Wylde's writing is smart, funny and sexy. I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when he's sure she's in it all the way. Mandy's had her eye on Shade but didn't make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser. 
 ""When I first met Rebel, I'd teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn't stop talking about the man. Then I'd met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn't have to work at it. He just was big and bad."" 
 Joanna Wylde's MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can't resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper's MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time. 
 ""He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we'd make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we'd probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don't even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel's ass and you know it!"" 
 Shade is NOT looking for an ""old lady,"" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends. 
 ""Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn't that guy. Never had been. Never would be."" 
 There's lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories. Loved visiting with the Reapers MC again. 'Shade's Lady' was a witty, funny, sexy and fast read. Highly recommend for all fans of MC romance.

"Holy hotness, Batman! So much to love about this book!! (And some things, not so much!) But overall, Hail Mary was a deliciously naughty sports romance with some unforgettable passion between the main characters. Nicola Rendell is definitely a writer to watch and her book kept me engaged and laughing until the very end. 
 This is a dirty, dirty book and LOTS of fun. Even if you don't usually read sports romance, give Hail Mary a try! You will love this very spicy and very funny story. I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults, with families, jobs, friends and very full lives. Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable. Yes, there is a touch if insta-love but it worked perfectly in this story. And the Chicago setting was fantastic. 
 Hail Mary was a well-written, engaging, romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year. There, I said it. Hello, champagne bottle! *Fans self* I truly loved this book and love this author's fresh writing style. What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other (sorry, a big turn-off for me). I also found it a little unbelievable that Mary had no clue who Jimmy was, when they both lived in the same city where he was a famous football star. But, other readers didn't seem to mind so read this little gem of a story and judge for yourself! It's got plenty of heat and humor to please even the most jaded romance reader. I can't wait to see what's coming up next for this wonderful new author! 
 ""Yeah? You think so? You think you can handle me?""

"This debut by Andrea Dunlop is a fascinating tale of friendship, first love and nostalgia. The three main protagonists - Brooke, Sophie and Alex - are all compelling and complex characters. We first meet the narrator Brooke when she runs into someone from her past. Alex is now a well-known photographer and he played a pivotal role in Brooke's life when she was in college studying abroad in France. 
 Not quite fluent in French, Brooke finds herself struggling with the language when she first arrives. I loved how the author explored the tole that language plays in our grasp and understanding of the world around us. 
 ""Je t'aime, darling, 'I like you, I love you.' What's the difference? Imagine not needing different words for love and like, half the girls I knew practically lived and died by the nuance."" 
 The beautiful and gifted Sophie, another American student, befriends Brooke and they become very close. Brooke cannot understand what Sophie sees in her but Sophie is not quite the perfect, gifted student athlete that everyone assumes her to be. Both girls see their time in France as a way to break free of the confines of their lives back home in America. 
 They become fast friends with Veronique and soon, her sexy cousin Alex, a photographer. Their family, while very glamorous, is also very dysfunctional. The dynamics are fascinating and Brooke is swept off her feet by the bohemian and free-thinking Alex. He surrounds himself with gorgeous models and artists but insists that he can see beyond the superficial. Brooke feels beautiful when she is with him and with Sophie. 
 ""...people see what they want to see. You will see what you want to see."" 
 Alex quite literally sweeps Brooke off her feet. His family owns homes all over France and the girls embark on a series of adventures with him and his family in Paris, Cap Ferrat and Nantes. If you have ever visited France, or just want to visit, this book will serve as a stunning travelogue to the magnificent country! I could almost hear the noises of Paris and feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun. Brooke is entranced with Alex and quickly falls under his spell. 
 ""It occurred to me that men like Alex knew how to make entrances, knew how to make you wait just long enough that you found yourself in touch with the exact despair you'd feel if they were to abandon you, then they'd show up to save the day a moment later and fill you with the joy of their presence, the relief of having been rescued from their absence."" 
 This story rockets to a stunning conclusion that was both inevitable and surprising all at once. It is a very powerful tale of friendship, love and second chances. The use of French throughout the book was perfect. I'm obsessed with this book! Perfectly written. And the cover is gorgeous. Did it make me painfully nostalgic for my twenties? Yes. I feel lost without these characters! A slow-build story that I won't soon forget. 
 ""But"" - Sophie bit the edge of her lip as if she could hardly contain her smile - ""it's going to be different for us. We're going to chose. We'll make our own destiny.""

"""Real love heals and forgives."" 
 Nicole Archer is a quirky, funny and very creative writer and this book is a wonderful addition to the 'Ad Agency' series! I was first introduced to this author with 'Road-Tripped', an eccentric, zany but very sexy and warm-hearted romantic comedy. In 'Head-Tripped' we meet another very original cast of characters who have a sweet, sweet slow build romance. 
 Effie is a brilliant violinist who was a child prodigy. She spent her childhood suffering under the weight of an overbearing mother and longing for a ""normal"" life. She moves to New York City for a fresh start and to try to escape the demons of her past. She is asked to stand in for her twin sister Callie (from 'Road Tripped') at an awards show and there she meets an insanely hot guy who captures her attention. 
 Elias just happens to be a world-famous rock star but Effie has led such a sheltered life that she has no idea who he is! Elias LOVES that about her. Especially when she thinks he could be a homeless guy with no job! Elias is suffering from writer's block and thinks Effie might just be the shot in the arm that his band Urban needs. 
 Effie has a lot of demons in her past and she is not completely honest with Elias at first. He has one hard and fast rule about his relationships and Effie is afraid she will lose him forever if he learns the truth about her. 
 ""This wasn't going to last. Bliss never lasted - it disappeared in an instant."" 
 Elias brings Effie on the band's world tour and they are a huge hit. Effie is a brilliant musician and she and Elias truly make beautiful music together. I loved these two characters - real, flawed, imperfect and very quirky. Both of them are searching for real, honest love. Would they both be able to overcome their past demons and the people who would stop at nothing to break then apart? 
 I LOVE how the author puts quotes at the beginning of each chapter, along with a fantastic playlist of songs that fit each chapter perfectly! Reading this book was a pure delight. It almost read like a travelogue at times as the band Urban travels all over the world to exotic locales on their concert tour. Effie truly is someone you would want as a best friend. This book is funny, sexxxxy, warm-hearted and very, very clever. Another win for Nicole Archer!

"3.5 STARS 
 Another sexy, modern contemporary romance from Katy Evans! Very enjoyable with a very relatable heroine. And Callan!! WOW!! 
 A very fast-paced and super-sexy story, 'Womanizer' takes place in Chicago and follows Olivia, a young intern at a hugely successful company owned by Callan Carmichael. Part of the Manwhore series, this book can absolutely stand on its own but favorite characters from the earlier books do make appearances here. Olivia is starting a new internship at Carma, Inc. and is determined to make a name for herself at the company. Even though her brother Tahoe helped her get the job, she is very driven and wants to make a great impression. 
 Callan and Olivia fall for each other very quickly, and even though they both know their relationship can't really go anywhere because of the nature of their working relationship, they feel an undeniable connection. Their dialogue and flirting is sexy and fun and Olivia doesn't expect them to last beyond the length of her summer internship. 
 Lots of readers will love 'Womanizer' for the main characters' chemistry, the settings and the feisty heroine. I enjoyed it as light and steamy story. If you are looking for a quick and upbeat romance with a super-hot hero, I would recommend this book. I loved the Chicago setting and smart heroine. The Epilogue was absolutely fantastic!

"3.5 Stars!! 
 Con Man is a perfectly romantic, slightly raunchy, very sweet comedy from one of my favorite authors. First, let's discuss what I loved. The cover is fantastic. The premise of the story is very clever, reminiscent of the movie 'Hitch' with Will Smith. Luke is an image consultant and works with his clients to make them more confident. T. Torrest writes a fantastic male POV and the book is very funny. 
 I loved Mia and could see that Luke should get her out of the ""friend zone"" almost from the very beginning - passionate, smart, funny, she is just a gorgeous woman. And she's curvy! Loved that. Their banter is very witty. 
 This is a fast read but I can't say that the characters will stay with me. I did love the tie-in to the 'Remember When' series (but you do NOT need to read that series first, this book is a complete standalone). There is a major twist to this book that I did not see coming but seemed a little confusing. 
 Overall, pick this one up if you're in the mood for a clever and sexy book written from a male POV. It's nothing too heavy and is an enjoyable read.

"""Sometimes you come across a rainbow story--one that spans your heart. You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it, but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought."" 
 What a beautiful journey! 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa. Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters. 
 ""I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen."" 
 The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book - harsh, stunning and dangerous. The descriptions of the land, its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical. I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears. Don't miss it!!

"5 STARS!! 
 An intelligent, twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night! I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. 
 ""I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?"" 
 But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. 
 ""I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person."" 
 Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really ""knew"" him at all. 
 ""Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day."" 
 But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! 
 'The Vanishing Year' has been called a ""domestic thriller"". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti. 
 Favorite quote: 
 ""It wasn't that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming, like a party card trick. A sleight of hand here, a simple misdirection there, and Voila, here's your dinner. Now, it crawls under my skin and festers there, like a chigger, and the whole thing makes me itch.""

 ""I'm good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You'll see."" 
 In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. 
 But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the ""real"" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? 
 ""Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt."" 
 I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries!

"The Starcrossed Anthology is sugar and spice and everything nice! Sexy, romantic and funny, Leisa Raven does the holidays right with this delightful anthology filled with some of my all-time favorite characters. I am a HUGE fan of the Starcrossed series so I was thrilled to get my hands on this juicy bundle of stories about the gang from The Grove! BAD ROMEO, BROKEN JULIET and WICKED HEART are among my top favorite stories and this anthology reminded me why I love this author's writing so much. There's a little drama, TONS of steam and hilarious laugh-out-loud moments! 
 'Have Yourself a Sexy Little Christmas' is Ethan and Cassie's story. They are newly engaged and more in love than ever. The dialogue is snappy and the story is perfect. Reading this, I remembered how much I adore Ethan Holt! 
 ""His intensity takes my breath away."" 
 The appearance of Ethan's old girlfriend stirs up unwelcome feelings of insecurity and jealousy in Cassie. Of all the stories, I was unsure of where the author was going with my favorite Star-crossed couple but their holiday story was perfect! 
 ""And judging from Ethan's dark determination, he aims to put everything with Vanessa firmly in the rearview mirror and reclaim me in the most primal way possible. Prove to me that as far as he's concerned, no other woman exists."" 
 SWOON! Part Two: The Naughty List is Liam and Elissa's story. He planned the perfect secret getaway but things go terribly wrong when the paparazzi make an appearance. It isn't easy being in love with a famous movie star but Lissa's man will do anything to prove that she's his one and only. Part Three: Happy Horny New Year is hilarious! Josh and Angel are perfect together and his POV provided some comic relief to this sweet and sexy anthology. If you are looking for a steamy and very romantic holiday romance, then the Star-crossed Anthology is perfect for you! Happy reading!

"Filled with biting wit and sharp observation, 'Evelyn, After' tells the story of one woman's struggle to come to terms with her once picture-perfect life. Alternating before and after a tragic accident, this book poses complex questions which are not always easily answered. 
 As I read this compelling story, I found myself asking, ""What would I do if this happened to me?"" At first, I thought the answer was clear. But as Evelyn's journey reveals, we don't always do what's right. People can be selfish and self-centered. The world can sometimes be a gray place. 
 Evelyn is the perfect wife and mother, devoted to her distant husband and her busy teenage son. But she has hidden her real self away for years, trying to be everything to everyone. She tries to please everyone but doesn't even realize it. The author has a very keen eye for suburban life: 
 ""Her real purse was shoved under the passenger seat, stuffed full of receipts and Kleenex and hand sanitizer and Band-Aids and cough drops and an emergency flashlight and anything else that any person in the world might need from her while she was near. An eternal diaper bag for the eternal mother."" 
 Of course this is a thriller and not everything is at it seems on the surface. Evelyn flip-flops between acting on what she has witnessed and letting everything go back to way it was ""before."" 
 Evelyn had been so sure just a few minutes ago. Gary had to turn this woman in. He had to tell the truth. It was the only way to put this behind them and start over. Now she didn't know anything. 
 Even though Evelyn does not behave in the most admirable way in the beginning of this story, I felt strongly sympathetic towards her and I found myself saying ""Yes! YES!"" to her during the course of this very readable book. Yes, there is cheating in this story, so if that is a hard limit for you, look away! But that theme was an integral part of this book and vital to Evelyn's growth. 
 She'd spent her whole life doing the right thing. That could be someone else's job now. She was moving on. 
 I could not put this book down! The synopsis intrigued me. And I loved the complete metamorphosis that Evelyn experienced. This book was at times tragic, funny, sexy and sarcastic. The author's musings on marriage were sharp and unwavering 
 Jesus, how had she become this? Her life had been deep and rich and complex once. She'd lived with her single mother and her older sister, and they'd been strong, resilient, quick. She'd taken city buses and negotiated dangerous neighborhoods even as a child, and she'd imagined herself growing into an artist with wild, creative friends who had little money but so much heart. 
 This was real page-turner, a mature story with mature themes and situations. I loved it!! The conclusion surprised me and was perfectly satisfying. Highly recommend! 
 From now on, if something was important to her, she would demand it. Because the truth was that she belonged anywhere she wanted to be, and she was beautiful just for being brave.",8,5,1,530,26.82,59.14,25.71,55.47,12.93,17.17,90.0,73.96,58.49,16.79,9.25,2.64,0.19,0.19,5.66,0.38,7.55,13.96,6.04,0.94,12.08,10.75,4.72,9.25,1.32,17.36,9.25,2.83,4.34,2.26,0.75,1.32,14.72,1.89,12.83,3.58,0.57,1.7,3.21,1.32,3.4,0.0,5.09,3.58,1.32,1.7,0.75,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,15.09,4.15,0.38,0.19,0.19,0.75,2.26,10.19,1.51,0.19,6.79,0.57,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.19,2.08,0.0,0.19,1.32,0.38,0.19,1.32,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.0,1.51,0.19,0.19,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.57,5.85,9.62,0.75,1.32,6.6,1.32,0.0,0.38,4.34,7.92,3.96,0.19,0.57,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.0,18.49,6.23,4.91,0.38,1.32,3.02,2.64,0
"I've been on a thriller kick lately so this easy read fit the bill. 'When All the Girls Have Gone' is intelligent, fast-paced and very creative. Max and Charlotte are very real and relatable characters. Loved the author's smart and snappy writing style! The romance felt completely honest, down-to-earth and very ""true"". 
 Jayne Ann Krentz is a new author to me so I very much enjoyed getting to know her writing style. She has legions of fans and I can see why. I adored Max, who is a man of few words but knows how to get the job done. He has a very painful past so his lovely romance with Charlotte seems all the more sweeter. Charlotte is a no-nonsense heroine, who finds herself working in a retirement home after making some big life changes. 
 Charlotte's step-sister Jocelyn is traveling to a retreat. The two sisters are very close but Jocelyn has protected and sheltered Charlotte all of their lives. A mysterious package arrives at Jocelyn's home while she is away and Charlotte learns that Jocelyn's best friend Louise has died. Jocelyn is unreachable, since she is on a ""no technology"" retreat. 
 Enter Max Cutler, who was already involved in the matter after being hired by a cousin of Louise's. Is Louise's sudden death related to Jocelyn's disappearance? The details begin to unfold in this delicious thriller. There are lots of shady characters and plenty of secrets. This is a quick, super-intriguing and twisty story that you can read in one day. I absolutely loved Max Cutler, with his smart, strong, quiet ways. He is my kind of hero! The romance is a quiet one but it fits perfectly with this story. There is tons of action and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading this book. 
 Jayne Ann Krantz is a skilled writer and Max and Charlotte's story grabbed me from the very first page. There are lots of surprises in this one with some humor thrown in for good measure. Charlotte and Max are a little awkward, very lonely and absolutely perfect together! If you love a good mystery with a little romance and a smart and ""spunky"" heroine, then you'll love 'When All the Girls Have Gone.' There are several characters' POV's in this book which kept me on my toes. All in all, an enjoyable, solid thriller with just the right amount of romance and danger!

"This book is a very engaging and emotional story that centers around Kathleen and Jack, co-workers who are romantically involved. The story starts off with a bang and launches right into the lives of these two and their families. If you are a fan of more mature romances, then this book is for you! Jack is a single dad, whose ex-wife moved across the country after their divorce. Kathleen works in her family's company along with Jack, and has some serious emotional baggage. 
 The author drew me right in with her flowing, easy writing style. A very talented writer, Ms. Locklear has created some very engaging and very ""real"" characters. No one is a billionaire, and these people have very messy and untidy personal lives. Just like real life! Jack and Kathleen's story is not all wrapped up neatly with a bow and I liked that, because real life is often messy and unpredictable. 
 There are some steamy romance scenes in this book but for the most part it is more like women's fiction. I really felt for these characters, and was very surprised at the turn this book took at the end. There are no cliches in this book and I loved how Kathleen acted when a very serious incident occurs near the end of this book. I also loved how the author did not portray Jack's ex-wife as totally villainous. I would like to know why she left her young daughter behind when she moved away after her divorce from Jack. 
 'Constellation' is a very passionate and heartwarming book that brings out lots of emotion. This story ends on a cliffhanger but I must find out what happens next!

"In the myth of the Minotaur, Theseus, son of King Aegeus, decides that he will slay the monster. He runs the beast through with a sword and then retraces his steps using the string, thus saving all the sacrifices that year and in the future. I've reached the center of the maze. I'm facing my very own Minotaur. 
 Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Her books never fail to enthrall, entertain and excite. 'The Pawn' is trademark Skye Warren: a sheltered, innocent young woman, smart but faced with almost insurmountable odds against her, and a dark hero, who seems unbearably cruel but who might just have a soft side. 
 Avery's whole world has collapsed and she faces loses her family's home. Her father is dying and she has nowhere to turn. She agrees to an auction, which goes against everything she believes in. Enter Gabriel Miller, dangerous, handsome and ruthless. Even though he was the cause of her family's downfall, can he possibly be her savior? 
 He steps back with a quiet laugh. ""You can run away, little virgin. But you'll come back."" I'm very afraid he's right. 
 Avery is afraid to trust Gabriel but she has nowhere else to turn. Gabriel turns out to be sensual and protective but even more mysterious than Avery first thought. He is her father's enemy but he can't stay away from Avery. 
 ""What am I then?"" 
 ""You're innocent. And I'm going to ruin you."" 
 The certainty in his voice chills me. 
 I devoured this dark and sexy book in one sitting. Skye Warren is the BEST at writing uber-sexy, controlling men and Gabriel Miller is one I won't forget! 'The Pawn' is a fast-paced tale of revenge and control, perfect for lovers of dark romance. Avery and Gabriel are perfect together and I was thrilled to have the second book to start immediately after finishing! 
 You can have my body, I think. But you can't touch my heart.

"If you need some light and frothy romance in your life, then you will love Emma Chase's latest story and her very funny, very male POV. 
 Prince Nicholas is the heir to the throne in a fictional country. This story is a pure fairytale, down to the names of some of the characters to the plot. Poor Nicholas has followed the rules his whole life. And now it is time for to select a wife, but only because his grandmother the Queen is forcing him to finally settle down. He can't bear the thought of it and takes off for the United States for one last ""fling"". 
 ""If you were told that the world as you knew it--life as you knew it--would end in five months, what would you do? You'd make the most of the time you had left, of course. Do everything you wanted to do--everyone you wanted to do--for as long as you could. Until time was up. Well...looks like I've got a plan, after all."" 
 Olivia is hard-working ""commoner"" who runs her family business in New York. She is having a tough time keeping the struggling diner going. Nicholas happens to stumble into the diner after a wild night of partying and is stunned by the beautiful Olivia. 
 If Helen launched a thousand ships, this girl could raise a thousand hard-ons. 
 Of course, their relationship is NOT supposed to happen! He can't possibly fall in love with a commoner! So they agree to a brief summer fling. Olivia is not easily impressed, but even she realizes that they both live in very different worlds. 
 ...I grab his arm, shaking. ""I don't think you understand--you live in a freaking castle!"" 
 ""Technically, it's a palace. Castles were built for defense, palaces more for the monarch to hold court in appropriate grandeur."" 
 And Jesus, I want to stick my tongue down his throat. ""Have I told you how hot it is when you roll out the royal facts?"" 
 'Royally Screwed' is a very charming fairytale with a healthy does of Emma Chase's trademark spicy humor. All of the characters also seem very down-to-earth with many of the same problems and heartaches as everyone else. 
 Nicholas knows he lives in an insulated world and he does his best to keep Olivia safe. But wicked characters are lurking everywhere, in the form of the paparazzi, jealous old girlfriends and even the Queen herself. Their relationship seems doomed from the start. 
 ""It not easy being my friend; it's even more difficult being my lover. Think of me as a walking exploding bomb--anything near to me will eventually become collateral damage."" 
 What I enjoyed about this book was the witty, sexy, fast-paced dialogue and the engaging supporting characters. There's also a wonderful theme of family and duty running through this story that I really loved. 
 The author has created a very relatable fairytale that provided an escape from real life. The ending was a lovely surprise and along with Nicholas and Olivia, I adored his brother Henry. I can't wait to read his story!

"Yes, you can have your wine and still lose weight! As a vegetarian for many years, I was excited to read this witty but very informative book that seemed right up my alley. If you have been looking for an easy, very down-to-earth way to eat healthier and maybe lose some weight in the process, then this book is a must-read. Filled with THE yummiest, easiest recipes, 'WTF Am I Supposed to Eat?' offers a common-sense, practical approach to a more delicious and healthier way of life. 
 I hate to use the word ""diet"" but trust me, you will definitely lose weight by following even just a few of the fantastic tips in this book. I have followed a modified version of the food plans in this book for most of my adult life and have maintained the same weight for many years. You don't have to be vegan or vegetarian to read this book but if you have been thinking about it, this book will give you the background and the confidence boost to try. 
 I loved this book because not only does the author explain why certain foods are good for you, she gives you super-easy recipes that are quick and satisfying. I also love her philosophy that everything is okay in moderation. You love red wine? It's okay! You can still keep your wine but also eat healthy the rest of the time (although I think a glass of red wine is good for everyone!) I also appreciated the variety of foods and the philosophy that not every diet plan is perfect for everybody,

"Katy Evans has created another sweet AND swoony hero! I read this hot romance between Matt and Charlotte in one siting. 'Mr. President' is a feel-good story set against the exciting backdrop of America's capitol. With the U.S. election season almost at an end, we all can use a good old-fashioned political romance! 
 Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families. Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S. president. Their futures seem pre-destined. But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life, until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life. She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president, that she would join his campaign. Now fast-forward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate. 
 He is very passionate about changing the world. Charlotte, who worked for her mother's organization assisting women in need, is totally captivated by him and can't hep but be mesmerized by him. This is a political campaign so Matt's every move is being watched. Charlotte is a campaign staffer. Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance? 
 I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics. Ms. Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows. Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together, even though this story was a slow-burn romance. It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon, in January 2017. I can't wait to see how Matt and Charlotte's romance plays out.

"I don't even know what to say about this book, other than I kinda enjoyed it! Look away now if dubious consent, violence and mind games turn you off. This oddly appealing story of a therapist's rapid fall from grace was recommended by one of my favorite writers, Varian Krylov. So I just knew I had to read this! 
 Dr. Crane begins treating Max, who very early on establishes himself as at the very least, amoral, and at the worst, a sociopath. But Crane, who is an inexperienced therapist just out of school, falls quickly under his patient Max's spell. 
 ""Are you afraid of me, Dennis? You shouldn't be. I'm trying my very best to make you understand that I like you. And I'm offering you the very thing you desire the most: me. You know I'm a fine specimen of amorality. I'm giving you the opportunity to look behind the curtain. No holding back."" 
 The levels of depravity this story sinks to are quite extreme. But I found the book to be surprisingly engaging and very well-written. Dr. Crane knew he was addicted to Max, yet he simply could not stop his increasingly twisted behavior. 
 He felt strangely light and calm, as if he'd used up all of his fear and trepidation and was left with nothing but serene acceptance. Maybe this was what Max felt like all the time. 
 This book is dark to the nth degree. But if you're in the mood for a bizarre and perverted story with some very black humor, then 'Max' might be just what you're looking for.

"Well. I was prepared to love this book. Even the clever cover grabbed my attention. While I deeply cared about the MC's, some parts of the book were a bit too slow for me and the endings felt rushed. So I really liked this book a lot. I loved the creative and clever plot and was totally taken by surprise by the conclusion. I never saw that coming! 
 I felt the deep connection between the MC's and it just felt ""right"". It seems that no one cared much for Mia, so much so that no one was sure she was actually missing as opposed to just being irresponsible. Cold, her kidnapper, actually saves her life by hiding her away once he realizes that she will be useless to his boss once a ransom is collected. 
 There is much more to the story: there is the sad tale of James and Eve's marriage, the father's coldness toward Mia for most of her life, and the superstar sister who outshines Mia at every turn. The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. 
 Lots of readers didn't like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book. All in all, a sturdy thriller hat kept me turning the pages all night. I cannot believe 'The Good Girl' is the first book by Mary Kubica!

"""You're the best mistake I've ever made."" 
 'Four Letter Word' (clever title, no?) was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeply-felt emotion. Brian and Sidney's story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying! 
 Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way. Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls, BUT it really worked for me! Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins, so she will she ever learn to trust another man again? Even one as ""perfect"" as Brian Savage? 
 ""I needed you, but I didn't know I needed you until you reached out to me."" 
 As with all of J. Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very ""real"". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! 
 Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! 
 'She couldn't know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.' 
 'Four Letter Word' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney's story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series!

 ""Today would be different. Tomorrow would be different. Forever would be different. She could fight me all she wanted. She could vent and freak the fuck out to whoever she was on the phone with. But, when I hit the bottom stair, I would not be leaving. Ever."" 
 While this book was very readable and had a fast-paced plot and interesting characters, it just didn't quite do it for me. I am in the minority on this one so read Retrieval for yourself and you might love it! I loved the scenes between Roman and Elisabeth and yes, they absolutely belong together! Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare. I adored Roman's sexy, uber-alpha ways. BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me. The ending felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to have have spent more time with the main characters before the book ended. 
 For example, during their separation, Roman sent Elisabeth huge company checks for several hundred thousand dollars. You can't just write a check like that without accounting for it on a balance sheet or an accrual. It's not like writing a personal check! And she never cashed them, which would also raise some accounting red flags. But, okay. 
 The catchy plot will definitely please most readers and Roman and Elisabeth are something special. The book ends very abruptly and the second book with be about Clare and another character from Retrieval. Overall, this was a fast and mostly enjoyable book.",10,4,1,254,26.6,15.33,23.69,50.44,11.55,18.9,87.4,72.83,60.24,13.39,8.66,3.54,0.0,1.18,1.97,1.57,4.72,14.17,7.48,2.36,10.24,11.42,6.69,9.06,1.97,17.32,6.69,5.51,1.18,0.79,0.0,0.39,14.57,1.97,12.6,0.39,0.0,3.94,2.36,0.79,5.91,0.0,3.94,2.76,0.79,1.57,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39,9.06,3.15,0.39,0.39,0.39,0.0,1.57,5.51,0.0,0.0,1.97,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.39,5.51,0.0,0.0,3.15,3.15,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39,1.18,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,5.12,5.91,0.39,1.18,3.54,0.39,0.0,0.39,5.51,5.51,2.36,1.18,1.18,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.0,16.54,7.87,3.94,0.0,1.18,1.57,1.97,0
"WOW!! An intense, sexy and VERY suspenseful romantic thriller with an edge. Lucas is one of the author's most memorable characters ever. 
 ""I wish she knew how much I want to be normal for her."" 
 Read the book description and then dive in to this fast-paced and dramatic story. I really don't want to go into too much detail because spoiler-free is the way to go with this one! Fans of J.B. Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive, damaged and protective heroes, but trust me, Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters. 
 Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life, having lived through a terrible trauma. His daily struggles are painful and feel very real. Told in alternating POV's, the book also tells Shyann's story. She has come back home, not exactly willingly, in order to start over again while working for her dad. 'Split' is not what you'd expect from J.B. Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story. With tons of suspense! 
 Lucas is a beautifully damaged soul who deserves a happily ever after. The ending surprised me but it was absolutely perfect for these characters! I LOVED Ms. Salsbury's venture into romantic suspense and can't wait to read more stories like 'Split.'

"4.5 Stars!! 
 ""Take the hoodie off. Please. I'll only look with my eyes."" 
 OMG this book was SO funny!! Sweet and sugary but sexy and romantic, too. I devoured this confection of a story. I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel! Every line was funnier than the one before. And the story was pure enjoyment! This book was the perfect antidote for me. 
 Lucy and Josh are co-workers at a large publishing company who end up competing for the same job. I am very picky about office romances because (a) I work in an office, and (b) they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple. Not 'The Hating Game'. The author nails the workplace setting perfectly. 
 Lucy and Josh HATE each other. Like, they can't even stand to be in the same room together. But they share an office! They are complete opposites in every way. He is cold and controlling, she is warm and friendly. He is REALLY tall, she is VERY petite. They tease each other incessantly. 
 ""Stop calling me Shortcake."" 
 ""Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day."" 
 The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious. The dialogue was fresh and original. 
 ""I don't like big guys. They're too much like horses. They could trample you if you got underfoot. He is auditing my appearance with the same narrowed eyes that I am. I wonder what the top of my head looks like. I'm sure he only fornicates with Amazons."" 
 Lucy and Josh eventually end of competing for the same job which would mean a huge promotion for both of them. Lucy comes to realize that their mutual and VERY public dislike for each other just might actually be mutual lust. She can't help but drool over Josh's perfection every single day. 
 ""Today is a magnificent black T-shirt day. Write today in your diaries. Tell your grandchildren stories about it. I tear my eyes away, but they slide back moments later. Underneath that T-shirt is a body that could fog an elderly librarian's glasses."" 
 This book reminded me of 'Tangled' by Emma Chase. The writing is smart, sexy, funny and very sharp. Both characters here are fully developed and the secondary characters are just as interesting! I fell in love with both Lucy's and Josh's families. AND I loved the characters' growth over the course of the book. 
 ""I've got so much inside me I have no idea about. I'm like the mayor of a city I've never seen."" 
 I highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for a sweet and sexy modern romance with the perfect amount of wit and sarcasm. 
 ""In the dark, I slide my body against his, feeling his sighs, and I tug him down to lie on me properly.

"I read this sweet and warm romance in one sitting. Not too much angst, but plenty of steam and heart to satisfy every fan of contemporary romance. The story revolved around a sexy pilot, Carter, who embarks on a romantic and unplanned adventure with Kendall, a girl who is running from her future. 
 'Playboy Pilot' is a fast-paced, glamorous story that takes the reader to places around the world. It is a bit of escapist fantasy that is grounded in reality but is very funny, sexy, and enjoyable. 
 Kendall and Carter meet in an airport when she is trying to decide what to do with the rest of her life. Carter is sexy as hell, a gorgeous pilot, and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life. Yes, Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past. This is ultimately a very sweet romance, filled with lots of heart, written in the style that I love by these two authors.

"What a perfect ending to a fantastic series! 'Beautiful' is a delicious, dizzying, sexy, funny and poignant story. 'Beautiful Bastard' was one of my earliest fanfic favorites and while I am sad that this series is ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this yummy story. 
 This is a light-hearted, upbeat and sexy book that delivers on all fronts. As with the earlier books, all of the characters are inter-connected. Jensen is Hanna's bother and Pippa is Ruby's friend. They meet in the most adorable way on an international flight but of course neither one knows the who the other is. They meet up again and of course, sparks fly. These two could not be more opposite: Pippa is breaking free from her old life and is living ""in the moment"" for the first time in her life, and Jensen is a complete workaholic. But opposites attract, right? So while on a road trip, Pippa and Jensen start a wild fling. 
 ""Your hair like this makes your eyes bluer,"" he continued, and my mind hit the brakes. ""Makes your lips pinker. Makes you look too perfect to be real."" 
 This is a fast-paced and endearing romantic comedy with an absolutely perfect Epilogue. I loved seeing the whole gang reunited again and enjoyed every minute of this book. Jensen and Pippa were fabulous together and the ending was exactly what I hoped for!

"OMG Chandler is SCRUMMY!! An unexpectedly funny and totally sexy story. Laurelin Paige continues to be one of my absolute favorite contemporary romance authors. 
 ""What can I say? I'm a guy who loves women. Lucky for me, women usually love me too. And why wouldn't they? I'm charming, young, good-looking, smart. Decent at my job, despite what Hudson tells anyone. Oh, and let's not forget, filthy rich. I'm shower masturbation material come to life."" 
 Chandler first appeared in the Fixed series, which is an absolute must-read. That series remains one of my favorite contemporary romance series and is filled with unforgettable characters. That being said, you do not have to read those books first. BUT you should!! 
 Chandler Pierce must work hard to prove himself in the family business, Pierce Industries, and must prove himself to his older brother Hudson. A complex and important company merger is at stake and Chandler knows he can help maneuver the players. Along comes the striking Genevieve, also part of a wealthy dynasty, and she is also working hard to prove herself valuable to her family's company. 
 This book is written with sizzling heat and tons of humor. It never takes itself too seriously and that is why I loved this book. Chandler is a reformed playboy and the unfamiliar feelings he has for Genevieve throw him for a loop. Even though he and Genny agree to a no-strings-attached arrangement, they both are surprised at their intense connection. 
 ""I take my belt, wrap it around my neck, and try to strangle myself before falling face-first onto her bed ... What the hell is she bringing out of me?"" 
 WHOA! I LOVED revisiting the characters from the Fixed series, and was totally taken aback with the turn of events here in 'Chandler'. This is a sizzlingly sexy, quick and funny read, written with wit and intelligence. Fans of Laurelin Paige will love it and new readers will become addicted to the world of the Fixed series.

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 I ADORE Renee Carlino and I think that all of her other books are beautifully written. 'Not in This Life' is one my top favorite books! 'Lucian Divine' did not have the depth that I expect from this writer's work. There was plenty of ""tell"" but not enough show. This lack of detail led to me not really feeling the bond between the main characters. 
 Without spoiling the plot, there are just too many open questions in this book. The ending felt rushed. There are elements of romance, sex and even humor here, but I never ""felt"" the love between Evey and Lucian. I like that the author wrote a story that is certainly different and unexpected. Some readers may enjoy this type of book, but it was just not for me. I loved the Epilogue and the ending for these characters was perfect. Definitely try this one and judge for yourself!

"This is a review for Mara White's 'Playing With Fire,' a sweetly sexy coming-of-age story about the new girl in school who also happens to like girls. 
 Delphine winds up in Ohio with her divorced mom, a far cry from the prestigious dance academy she attended in New York. She is befriended by an odd but loyal friend, Alex, and sets her sights on the beautiful dance teacher, Ms. Amber Johnson. Their romance is more sweet than sizzling hot, but Ms. Johnson is the one who knows they cannot continue in any kind of relationship. 
 Lucky for Delphine, Amber convinces her of the benefits of joining the dance team (which means a chance for a trip back to New York for the annual competition). I loved that none of the high school students were stereotyped characters in this novella, and everyone seemed to be quite accepting and open to have Delphine in their midst. That was a plus for me! 
 I adored the lovely and passionate Epilogue and was so happy for these characters to find their beautiful HEA's. I can't wait to read the rest of the stories in this amazing anthology!

"'A Veil of Vines' is a lush and very sweet romance that will sweep you away to the vineyards of Italy. Yes, it is predictable but if you are looking to be lost in a book for a day or two, then this is the perfect story for you. 
 Caresa has always know that she would be married to an heir of the Savonas, a former royal family of Italy. A dutiful daughter, she agrees to travel to Italy to meet and then marry Zeno Savona, the dashing prince. Yes he is handsome and wealthy but Caresa's heart is not at all in the right place. Soon she meets Achille, the sweet, kind and gorgeous winemaker who lives on the Savanna's property. 
 Achille was not what I expected! Bravo to Ms. Cole for creating an unexpected hero. Shy and very humble, Achille creates some of the world's finest wine yet he is largely unaware of the acclaim his wine has achieved. Part forbidden love story and part sexy contemporary romance, 'Veil of Vines' is pretty much drama-free but does pack a solid emotional punch. 
 ""Once you find that person, your 'split-apart', you are blanketed by such belonging, such desire, that you will never want to be without it. And they don't want to be separated from one another, not even for a moment"" 
 There are some heartbreaking moments in this book but all is well in the end. I appreciated the connect of this lovely romance and I loved the hero, Achille. This is actually one of my favorite of Tillie Cole's books so far.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 One of Alessandra Torre's best books. Couldn't put it down!! Crisp, concise, fast-paced and enthralling. All of the ingredients for a great read! 
 ""If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth."" 
 This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn't want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm's length. 
 ""On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena's madness just took longer to come out."" 
 But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn't have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. 
 ""What's happened to me? I have a story that I don't have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I'm dying, and it's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time."" 
 Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader's attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena's life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. 
 ""You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don't mind if they know I've had help."" 
 They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? 
 This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena's own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. 
 ""Boys like him don't go for girls like me, they don't follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don't lean closer or want more."" 
 I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive. I have never read anything like it. Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one!

"This book has a fascinating premise! Taylor is a famous computer genius who invents a new program. On the day he unveils it, he is very publicly hacked and the program is shut down. How could this happen to what is supposed to be a non-crackable code? Taylor tracks down the location of the hacker and attempts to find out. 
 Going from the world of Silicon Valley to Small Town USA is quite a shock to Taylor. In what is part suspense and part sexy contemporary romance, C.D. Reiss spins a tale of two brilliant characters who are from different worlds, yet are very much alike. 
 After much sleuthing, Taylor uncovers the identity of the hacker and it turns out the hacker is a she: the very beautiful, passionate, sensitive and talented Harper. Taylor and Harper fall into a hot and sexy relationship and it turns our they are really very much alike. All Taylor wants is his code back and then he can get out of the suffocating town of Barrington. But Harper has other ideas. What is she after? Revenge? For what? Or is she simply after money? 
 ""Was she playing some kind of game? No matter how many ways I peeled this onion, I couldn't get to the center. Was she after my heart? Had she changed the fucking rules?"" 
 C.D. Reiss writes in a trademark staccato, no-nonsense style which I love. Her words are witty and to the point. I felt, however, I needed a little more connection between Taylor and Harper even though I enjoyed their sexy times. This story had the potential for me to be a great book, but it needed more detail to the plot. Certain plot points felt too abrupt to me and I would have liked them to have been more fleshed out. But Ms. Reiss is a terrific romance writer and the scenes between Taylor and Harper were HAWT!! 
 ""Nothing had ever felt that good. Nothing except falling on her and burying my face in her neck, drinking in the scent of infinite possibilities."" 
 There is social commentary woven in here about the decline of small town economies in the US as well as the difficulties faced by women in the tech world. But the heart of the story is Taylor and Harper and their chemistry together. Taylor is much more than simply Harper's boyfriend; he is her other half. 
 ""I'm your mate. A boyfriend can be stolen. A mate can't."" 
 Will Taylor find the solution to the hack? Will Harper help him or will she refuse to give up her secrets? Can these two possibly find happiness together? 
 I am a huge fan of C.D. Reiss and her books are among my favorites. But for me, I simply couldn't connect with the characters in 'King of Code' and didn't buy into the demise of the town of Barrington. I am going to assume all of the tech talk is accurate because that is way over my pay grade! 
 My pet peeve is naming fictional characters after people IRL. That takes me right out of a story. (How about sending flowers or a signed book to the friend you want to thank or honor? Is that absolutely unheard of?) Obviously this is peculiar to me but it does affect my enjoyment of a book. 
 Many early readers love this book so definitely give it a try if you're looking for a romantic mystery/suspense story with a side of sexy! 
 ""You belong to me. I didn't even exist until we met. I wasn't a man before you. I was an idea. I don't want to be an idea anymore. I want to be real. I can't be real without you.""

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 One of my favorite writing duos! I have read several of the Merikan sisters' M/M and M/F books and they never disappoint. This book, which could read as a standalone, is a side story to Seth and Dom's story. But if you have not yet read the other Guns 'n Boys books, get them!! They are totally addictive! 
 Lucrezia is promised to Seth in marriage by her father. Even though she is very young and naive, she dutifully goes along with her father's plan. Until of course she meets Santo, who is tasked with escorting her safely to meet her future husband. 
 Santo and Lucrezia are HOT but their relationship is completely forbidden. Each one of their encounters is laced with danger. I definitely want to read more about Santo: he could have an entire book written just from his point of view! Handsome, dominating and smart, Lucrezia can't resist him. 
 This is without a doubt a violent mafia romance but yet it is not quite as bloody or strange as some of the books I've read by this duo. Lucrezia is almost an old-fashioned woman, from the way she dresses to her speech to her mannerisms. And even though Santo lives in a world of constant violence, he was sexy and romantic and almost tender with the beautiful Lucrezia. 
 'Blood & Marriage' is a super fast-paced and spicy read, with all of the trademark sexual tension and wonderfully descriptive writing I have come to expect from Miss Merikan. A great addition to a wonderful series.

"This was my first book by Kirsty Moseley and I really enjoyed it! Jamie Cole is a an AMAZING main character. He is thoughtful, brave, HOT as hell and COMPLETELY selfless. This story is incredibly well-written and very, very heartfelt. Jamie and Eliie's star-crossed love is thrilling and beautiful! The ending took me by surprise. More to come soon.

"Mind-bending and completely unique, take a chance and read this book!! This fast-paced, twisty science-fiction thriller was just what I needed to get out of a reading slump! Even if you don't usually read this genre, DON'T MISS DARK MATTER! It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end. 
 There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen, because to me, the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book. I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. 
 ""My life is great. It's just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been."" 
 ""You killed your ambition, didn't you?"" 
 ""It died of natural causes. Of neglect."" 
 Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can't tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. 
 ""I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces."" 
 Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won't soon forget. 
 ""It's the beautiful thing about youth. 
 There's a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made, no paths committed to, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited potential.""

 ""My name is Scarlet Stone and my biggest fear is that someday I will find what I want most in life and it will be impossible to steal."" 
 Leave it to Jewel E. Ann to write THE most creative, refreshing and inventive storylines ever! Nothing you have ever read will prepare you for Scarlet Stone. A beautiful and sexy and surprising book, Scarlet and Theo will draw you in and steal your heart. Their story is gorgeous and their chemistry was real and very, very hot. 
 ""What if we started counting time in breaths instead of seconds? What if I could hold my breath and stop time?"" 
 All of the characters in this book are unforgettable. I don't know how Jewel E. Ann dreams up these larger-than-life personalities but I hope she never stops. Just when I thought I knew the direction this story was going in, it completely changed course! You can read the synopsis for this story but it is best read not knowing more so I will try to keep this review spoiler-free. 'Scarlet Stone' is funny, sexy, heartbreaking, emotional and very, very different. This author never disappoints. Scarlet is one of the most memorable heroines I have ever read! 
 ""My name is Scarlet Stone, and I'm drawn to anything out of the ordinary, the crazy, the eccentric. I've been this way all my life."" 
 If you are looking for an out-of-the-ordinary romance with tons of heat and heart, do not miss 'Scarlet Stone'! It is wildly inventive and perfectly readable. Another fantastic read from one of my favorite authors!

"""Come back to me, Georgia."" 
 The first book in the new Brooklyn Bruisers series was a total delight! ROOKIE MOVER has everything I love about Sarina Bowen's books: great writing, smart women, fine and sexxxy hockey players, and sweet, sweet first love. 
 Georgia and Leo have been apart for years after having been in love when they were in high school. Now Leo is the new trade for the Brooklyn Bruisers hockey team, where his former girlfriend is also working. Leo has never gotten over Georgia, and even though she was the one who broke up with Leo, she has never gotten over him, either. She has followed his career and now is face to face again with her one true love. 
 Ah, Leo. Georgia's happiness was all he ever cared about. His past with Georgia might keep him from reaching his full potential with the team, but he will never betray her secrets. He is a sexy, sweet, talented hockey player who brings just the right amount of steam and sweetness to this book. It's obvious these two still care for each other and their chemistry still burns bright after all these years have passed. 
 ""So fucking good,"" ... 
 ""Now give me that mouth."" 
 Sarina Bowen writes some of THE best sports romances around. There are great supporting characters in this book, and I'm thrilled that the next book will be O'Doul's story. ROOKIE MOVE is a fantastic start to the new Brooklyn Bruisers series! Highly recommended for all fans of sweet, steamy second-chance romances.

"3.5 Stars 
 I LOVED the premise of this book: a female motorcycle racer named Kenzie who races professionally. Her father was a legendary racer, and Kenzie is trying to carry on the family name. The racing scenes are fascinating and the story is very fast-paced. The author gives us an intimate, behind-the-scenes look into the highly competitive world of motorcycle racing. 
 Racing is literally in Kenzie's blood. She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan. Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly off-limits to Kenzie. She is downright mean to him at first, and they have a love-hate thing going on that was very intense. Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which, of course, turn out to be completely wrong. Hayden is sex--on-wheels and he and Kenzie begin a Romeo-and-Juliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone. 
 Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him. They both actually race better when they are competing against each other. I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart, strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport. Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful, sexxxxy and very believable. Overall, I really liked this book; it is a nice beach or poolside read and although some readers are not happy with the ending, I loved it!! There will definitely be more books to come in this series, and the next one sounds like it will be verrrry interesting!!

"""Cheers,"" she says, raising her tumbler. ""To remembering."" 
 Frank clinks his glass against hers and he smiles. ""And to you,"" he says. ""For being so generous."" 
 ""Oh,"" she says. ""I don't know about generous. Stupid more like."" 
 ""Maybe both,"" he says. 
 ""Yeah. I'll go with that. Story of my life. Generous and stupid."" 
 OMG!!! I did not want this book to end!! What a page-turner. Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell's writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. 
 This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. 
 Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. 
 ""How long have you been sitting out here?"" 
 ""I got here yesterday."" 
 ""Where did you come from?"" 
 ""I have no idea."" 
 This brilliant story is told from multiple POV's spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds ""Frank"" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all. The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book. 
 There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader. We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all. 
 Flashing back decades before, young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents. Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily. To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement! From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town, 'I Found You' sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year. 
 Long after finishing this book, I still can't stop thinking about the characters. Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine. This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles. Alice was completely relatable, even when she didn't make the wisest of choices. 
 I can't recommend this book highly enough! I loved every word.

"3.5 Stars 
 'The Protector' is a perfectly enjoyable, sexy, fast-paced story. 
 While it perhaps did not live up to JEM's superb story-telling potential, it was nonetheless am interesting and super-sexy story. I loved how the author presented another side to the heroine Camille: to the world, she is a rich, spoiled socialite. But she is actually smart and very ambitious and determined to build her own business from the ground up. She made lots of mistakes in the past, and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now. 
 Jake is PURE Alpha, a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD. Camille does not want his protection, AT ALL, but her father hires Jake to make sure that Camille is safe. Jake is also haunted by his own personal demons, but sees his job with Camille as a chance at redemption. 
 JEM remains one of my auto-buy authors. Her 'This Man' series is without question among my top favorite books of all time! And I absolutely fell in love with Miller in the 'One Night' series, another series that I HIGHLY recommend. Both Jesse and Miller are uber-Alphas beyond compare. 
 So I thought 'The Protector' had lots of sizzling sex scenes and very fast-paced action along with a mystery story as well. While this is not my favorite JEM story, definitely give the one a try if you love this kind of contemporary romance!

"GOOD LORD!!! I picked this book up on a whim and it was fabulous! Hot, Alpha rancher who has a very kinky side meets down-on-her-luck former beauty queen and sparks fly. The banter between Bran and Harper was genuine and real and witty and the sex is TOTALLY off-the-charts naughty. I was completely engrossed in small-town Wyoming life while reading this story, and it was perfect for a few hours of escape. I haven't read Book #1 and these characters all stood on their own, but I feel a binge-read coming on.

"""I like to have a martini, two at the very most. After three I'm under the table, after four I'm under my host."" - Dorothy Parker 
 What a riot!! I don't often love romantic comedies because they're usually, well, not so funny but 'Road-Tripped' is a welcome surprise! Do NOT read this if you are easily offended by dirty language but DO read this if you're in the mood for a modern, sexy, hilarious story. Nicole Archer has a very fresh voice and I look forward to big things from her! And I LOVE the cover. 
 First, I was surprised to learn that this was the author's debut book. The story is unique, the dialogue snappy and funny and sarcastic and the characters felt real and well, just perfect! There are wonderful quotes placed at the beginning of each chapter along with a fantastic playlist; all in all, there was a lot of thought that went in to the writing and production of this book. 
 Callie Murphy has zero filter and a big temper. She's witty, sarcastic and just moved across the country to New York City on the heels of a really bad break-up. She's working at her friend Skip's ad agency and is assigned to take a road trip with the one person in the office she absolutely cannot stand, Walker Rhodes. They are supposed to drive cross-country in a camper, all for work, of course. 
 Walker is sexy, irresistible to everyone in the office except Callie and is at a crossroads in his life. He is a brilliant photographer but feels unfulfilled at the ad agency. Funny, a little nerdy and absolutely gorgeous, Walker is actually a really good guy. As they travel all over the country, will Callie see the real Walker? Nicole Archer takes one my favorite tropes, enemies-to-lovers, and turns it into a fantastic and very readable story. 
 There is tons of steam in this book, and it is FUNNY as well as sexy. The writing is laugh-out-loud hilarious as well as very heartfelt. 
 ""She raked her fingers down his back. Swoosh, bang, crackle - her body lit up with the fireworks and sang 'God Bless America.'"" 
 The story was not at all predictable and was filled with surprises all along the way. I loved the description of each place Walker and Callie visited. This is how a romantic comedy should be written. Sweet, sexy and charming, 'Road-Tripped' hit all the high notes. Grab this one if you are looking for a break from a traditional romance novel or you just need a break for a few hours from real life! Can't wait to read more from this very talented author.

"""I'm cold. I'm hungry. I'm frightened."" 
 And so begins this extraordinary story of Elsa and Thibault, who meet purely by accident while she is in a coma. The story is vibrant and alive even though much of is it set in a hospital. 
 Elsa was a fearless and experienced mountain climber who was critically injured in a tragic climbing accident. The accident left her in a coma from which it seems that she will never awaken. 
 ""Elsa is the mountains. When you walk across a mountain with her it's like seeing her and it stripped bare. Open to possibilities. All her emotions are raw. She's wonderful."" 
 Elsa is trapped within her own body but she can hear everything around her. She guesses that she is in a hospital but she can't feel anything. She can hear her parents approach her hospital bed, but she can only guess that they kiss her on the cheek or touch her arm. She can hear her sister's constant chattering, but cannot feel if someone moves her or adjusts her tubes. 
 Elsa desperately wants to move and to cry out but she can't even feel her vocal chords so she does not know if she even has the ability to speak. Into this world literally stumbles Thibault, who is trying to escape his own personal hell: his brother has caused a terrible accident and Thibault cannot bring himself to visit yet. 
 I was incredibly moved by this story and the touches of beauty and humanity and even humor. I was astounded by the ethical questions this book raises about hospital care and outraged by the sometimes careless way that Elsa was treated, even by her family. 
 ""They are whispering to each other. I hate it. You'd think they had just stepped into a mortuary. I want to cry out that I'm still here, alive, right next to them, but they carry on talking in low voices as though they don't want me to hear them."" 
 Thibault is the only one who treats Elsa like a human being and speaks to her normally. She is a bright spot in Thibault's life and he finds her extraordinarily beautiful even in her absolute stillness. Elsa begins to crave his visits and longs for the moment when she can move or even open her eyes to see him. 
 ""...Thibault is different. He's my secret. He's my breath of fresh air. Even though I don't have a clue what he looks like."" 
 I'm Still Here is a very powerful debut from Clelie Avit. It is an incredibly thought-provoking and humane story that can be read in one sitting. I was absolutely enthralled from the very beginning and highly recommend this very unusual and satisfying book!

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 Written in an unusually quirky style, Professed is a student/teacher romance about Ben, a college professor and 20-year-old Naomi. I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story, but once I did, I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance. 
 First, heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit! Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair. Dr. Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale. He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically, now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi. 
 Once they become aware that Naomi is Ben's student, they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking. Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty, at the very least. But this is actually a very fast-paced book and the author's brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story. 
 ""Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest."" 
 There are lots of things I loved about this book and some, not so much. I loved reading about Naomi's background and her family: she was raised by her father, a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale. I would have loved to read more about Ben's background! The book is told in alternating POV's and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes. 
 Naomi's character was unusually mature for her age. Although I did not have an issue with the age gap, I was not totally convinced what a 38-year-old would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior. I would have also loved to have known more about the ""secret society"" masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met. 
 I loved Naomi's best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious! This is certainly not your average student-teacher forbidden romance and for that, I applaud the author. Overall, Professed is a very sexy, very enjoyable and promising debut story.

"I adore Alexa Riley, I really do! Their short stories are my not-so-secret addiction. I think I've bought every one of them! 'Mechanic' is one of my favorites. So I was very excited to read their first full-length book. Unfortunately this story just didn't do it for me. The overly-possessive, controlling and bossy hero didn't even bother me at all; in fact he's a part of this writing duo's charm! Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her. What bothered me was that the heroine was a Yale grad but she sure didn't act like one. In addition, I had several issues with the plot which sadly interfered with my enjoyment of the story. And when did Nordstrom come to Manhattan? (Answer: it didn't. Nordstrom Rack doesn't count.) I'll continue to buy and read Alexa Riley's books, but this one was a miss for me.",9,3,1,147,11.13,2.94,51.8,73.42,10.5,14.29,86.39,72.79,61.9,21.09,14.97,9.52,0.0,0.0,3.4,2.04,6.12,17.01,4.76,3.4,10.88,12.24,5.44,6.12,3.4,19.73,2.72,8.16,2.04,0.0,0.68,1.36,10.88,1.36,9.52,2.04,0.68,0.68,0.0,0.68,5.44,0.0,4.76,4.08,0.68,3.4,2.72,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.68,0.0,13.61,6.8,0.0,0.0,0.68,1.36,3.4,7.48,0.0,0.0,2.04,2.04,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.68,2.72,0.0,0.0,2.04,0.68,0.0,0.68,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.68,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.72,2.72,0.0,1.36,2.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.04,10.2,2.72,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,25.85,6.8,2.72,0.68,2.04,8.16,5.44,0
"""I love you all the way."" 
 This is an EPIC story that was simply unputdownable, filled with characters that I will never, ever forget. The writing is outstanding! Nothing I can say in a review will do any justice to this gem but I will try. 
 Certainly not a story for everyone, the book is at its heart a love story and what can happen when two human beings really, truly, deeply love each other and care for each other. Wavy and Kellen meet when she is just a young girl, but she is wise beyond her years, having suffered horrible emotional and physical abuse. Wavy has the misfortune to be the daughter of a meth dealer and a mentally-unstable mother. She learns young how to take care of herself and fly under the radar. 
 There are lots of adults who drift in and out of her life and it is heartbreaking to see how misguided almost all of them are. From a well-meaning aunt to teachers who should know better, everyone basically fails Wavy and her little brother. Except for Kellen. 
 ""He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love"" 
 He is the one constant in her grim life, the one person she can always count on, no matter what. He provides her with shelter, clothing, all the basic needs that a parent should, plus love. I never viewed their relationship as odd, mostly because of the insightful points of view of the main characters. But for sure some readers will be uncomfortable with their age difference. 
 The author's use of different narrators is brilliant. Especially sympathetic is Wavy's cousin, who is in awe of Wavy's wild ways. Wavy lives on and off with her aunt and cousins, but they really never know the depth and depravity of Wavy's unstable home life. 
 ""Wavy in her black leather boots didn't fit in the catalog. She tore open the catalog and made surprising things happen. Like Ken in a dress."" 
 This book is the best book I've read all year. I could not put it down. My favorite parts of the book are when the author Bryn Greenwood describes how painful it is for Wavy to speak. Words are almost real, tangible things for Wavy, that can be felt and tasted. Brilliant. 
 This story spans many years and is filled with some of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever read. I absolutely loved how whip-smart Wavy was, and how she silently observed and took in everything around her. She is obsessed with the constellations and her sweet spot is gazing at the stars at night with her beloved Kellen. 
 ""I liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years."" 
 Wavy never lost hope and pushed forward though life no matter how dire her circumstances were. My heart also broke for Kellen, a giant of a man who always treated Wavy with love and tenderness. They had a bond that was unbreakable. I can't think of anything more to say about this stunning book other than to please read it! It will change your life. 
 ""I wanted a fairy tale ending for Wavy, because if she could find happiness, there would be hope for me, too.""",27,5,1,569,40.65,46.29,11.84,55.82,12.93,15.11,87.52,73.11,58.35,13.53,8.79,2.64,0.0,0.35,4.22,0.88,4.75,16.52,6.85,0.53,12.13,8.96,7.03,6.68,2.46,16.87,7.73,4.22,2.81,1.58,0.88,0.35,17.57,4.57,13.01,3.34,2.46,2.64,1.41,1.23,3.34,0.18,8.44,5.1,2.81,4.04,2.28,1.05,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,15.29,5.27,1.05,0.18,0.0,0.35,1.93,9.14,1.41,0.0,4.39,1.05,0.18,0.18,0.0,0.0,1.76,0.0,0.18,1.58,0.0,0.0,1.58,0.18,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.53,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.18,6.33,7.73,0.7,0.7,4.57,0.7,0.18,0.35,3.87,4.22,5.45,1.41,0.18,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.0,15.29,7.38,4.04,0.0,0.35,1.23,2.28,0
"""It's never too late to change the road that you're on."" 
 The synopsis for this book really grabbed my attention. Jessica is a doctor at a women's prison and finds old letters written by an inmate that were never delivered. She makes it her mission to find the man the letters were written to, and her search leads her to a small beachside town. The residents are a tight-knit group but Jessica, who had been restless in her professional and personal life, finally feels like she is ""home"". 
 This is small-town romance at its best. I LOVED this very sexy, tender, warm-hearted and mature love story!! My favorite kind. The One Real Thing has fabulous writing and interesting, real and loyal secondary characters. 
 Cooper and Jessica share a deep connection and if you like off-beat characters with some good old-fashioned romance, then you will love this book. I am looking forward to more books in this series about the rest of the inhabitants of Hart's Boardwalk.

"What a BEAUTIFUL story!! Love the first book in this new series. Ms. Bromberg certainly does not shy away from the tough issues. 
 ""He brings calm to the chaos spinning out of control around me and withing me."" 
 'Cuffed' was a passionate, emotional and engaging story about two long-lost friends. Grant and Emerson were best friends many, many years ago. Something happened and Grant never saw Emerson again. Not until they were adults and she acts like she wants NOTHING to do with him. Yes, this is a book about second chances and a sexy cop - but it is also SO much more! 
 ""I only live in the now. I only live in tomorrows. I can only cope with the future I make for myself."" 
 'Cuffed' is not a lighthearted story but it is very readable and as always, features an incredibly feisty and resilient heroine. I can always count on Kristy to create very real and very down-to-earth main characters. Emerson is all that and more. She struggled to overcome her painful past but sometimes we must never forget those awful experiences so that we can move forward in life. 
 This is definitely a sexy, exciting romance (Hello, Grant!!) but is it also a story of overcoming your past and living in the present. This is the first book in a series about three sexy brothers and I just love the concept of ""Everyday Heroes.""

"Single hot dad alert!! 
 The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister, and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband, and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that's for sure - he's totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. 
 They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew's daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. 
 Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it's not enough to scare me away. In fact, it's the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. 
 The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. 
 ""I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can't handle it another second."" 
 I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew's relationship grew and developed. This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I can't wait to read what's next!!

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 A totally addictive but very, very sad story. I felt like I was witnessing a train wreck! The writing was for the most part very gripping, but this book is NOT for everyone. Tori is a romance author who feels very restless and unfulfilled in her personal life. Her husband Landon is a rising star in the restaurant world and she has two young children. She seeks fulfillment outside her marriage and finds one in an online relationship that eventually turns into a full-blown affair. Many tears are shed and much angst ensues. 
 The writing style threw me off a bit and interfered with my enjoyment of the story, but overall, I will say that I couldn't put this book down. So for that, kudos to E.K.

"4.5 STARS!! 
 Hellllooooo Coach Winter!! What a sexxxxy and intense sports romance!! I loved it!! Fascinating characters, a timely storyline and SUPER-hot steamy scenes make this book a winner!! R.S. Grey shows that she can write a great adult romance with this story. With the 2016 Summer Olympics right around the corner, this book about Olympic athletes hits all the right notes. Plus, it offers an intimate look into the often-isolated life of an elite gymnast. 
 ""I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. In gymnastics, if you're good, you're lonely."" 
 Brie Watson is the Cinderella story of the international gymnastic world. She and her mother have sacrificed EVERYTHING to get her to the Summer Games. And her coach Erik Winter knows all too well the pressures she is under, having suddenly dropped out of competitive athletics when he was at the top of his game. They are kindred souls, even though they fight constantly and even in the face of Erik's apparent iciness towards her. 
 ""She was fierce; she wanted to be seen, and not just for her gymnastics skills. No, she wanted to be desired. Coveted. Craved. Had anyone ever touched her the way she wanted to be touched?"" 
 This might be THE sexiest book yet from Ms. Grey. The passion between the hero and heroine literally lept off the pages!! I absolutely love the enemies-to-friends trope and it is done to perfection here. 
 ""Toying with Brie was quickly becoming my favorite pastime and a part of me wondered why I was doing it. Yes, she was disrespectful and constantly talked back during practice, but she was hardly the first strong-headed girl in my gym to be guilty of that. No, I was enjoying her punishment a little too much."" 
 OUT OF BOUNDS has the perfect blend of intense sports scenes, sexy, adult romance and emotion. There's no unnecessary drama here, just a perfectly readable, hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters. Even if you're not a fan of sports romance, give this one a try. You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 ""Don't focus on the what ifs. Focus on what is."" 
 Vi Keeland continues to shine in this very enjoyable and well-written office romance. I have loved Ms. Keeland's writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series (Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion). I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman, a story that combines elements of humor, wit and the perfect amount of drama. Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart, driven, a little sarcastic and very funny. She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue. The whole situation is handled so perfectly! Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming, and surprise! It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brand-new job. The company has a no-fraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a co-worker. She has no intention of dating Chase, but he sure has fun pursuing her. 
 Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered, ""Stop worrying. Harassment policy only applies to employees, not the owner. Checked this morning."" 
 I absolutely loved the slow-burn romance between Chase and Reese! Even though they do not fall into bed immediately, there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together. She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her boss's boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist. But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two, his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship. 
 ""Sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you find it"" 
 I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase. The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked! I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent. I absolutely fell in love with Chase!! He's the total package and Reese's feelings for him just felt right. 
 ""I'm tired of looking back. It's been a long time since I've wanted to live in the moment."" 
 If you are new to Vi Keeland, give Bossman a try! It's got the perfect combination of great chemistry, emotion, a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter. I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chase's story. Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland, surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!!

"""Life begins at the end of your comfort zone"" 
 This is my first book by Kat and Stone Bastion and I was very taken by their writing style. This story is heavy on the dialogue and light on explicit scenes but the character development and the sense of place was fantastic! The vivid description of Hawaii and other locations was beautiful. 
 Mase has fled his carefully planned-out life for the complete freedom of surfing. He lives simply but is drawn into a possible sponsorship with a board manufacturer by the stunning Leilani. Her brother has sent her to try and make a deal with Mase. He has no interest in the ""going commercial"" but he falls fast for Leilani. 
 Mase travels to Maui to meet with Leilani's brother and basically encounters prejudice the minute he arrives there. He is considered an ""outsider"" and his relationship with Leilani is immediately called into question. Leilani, who is at home in Hawaii, feels just as out of place in Mase's world as he does in hers. Will they be able to overcome everyone else's pre-conceived notions about them? 
 This is the first book I have read by Kat and Stone Bastion. The story is captivating and richly detailed. I also loved that this was a book about surfing. And, even though this is the second book in a series, you can absolutely read it as a standalone, as I did. To me, the writing almost bordered on spiritual at several points in the story, which fit in well with the overall tone of the book. Finally, 
 kudos to the authors for their wonderful description of Hawaii life and language! I am looking forward to reading more from these authors.

"3.5 Stars 
 If you like lots of high school drama, then this book is for you! Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways. However, the over-the-top cruelty of Reed and Ella's fellow students here turned me off. The main characters have lots of promise, and I really loved Reed and Ella. Many readers love this series, so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guilty-pleasure read! 
 ""He told me to stay away. He told me I didn't belong. If only I'd listened to him."" 
 The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment, former mean-boy Reed is desperate to find Ella. She has brought happiness and goodness to his royally-screwed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love. BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way! 
 ""I can play this two ways. I can walk away. Or I can fight for you. Guess which one I'm doing?"" 
 This is very quick read and a very fast-paced story. The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented, and I love their other books. If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soap-opera, then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff. But be warned: there is another cliffhanger! 
 I did love reading Reed's POV in this book. I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs. I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!! There was just way too much unnecessary over-the-top drama for me. But if you are looking for a summer pool or beach read, then pick up Broken Prince and enjoy the crazy ride!

 This is a slow build romance and I absolutely loved the incredibly witty and sexy banter between the characters. Conway's writing is always a winner for me. This book has tons of heart, heat and sexy times! The chemistry between the characters was real and the contrast between Stu's toughness and Andie's sweetness was perfect. I read this book in one sitting and 'Thief of Hearts' is one more reason why L.H. Cosway is an auto-buy author for me. Her writing flows perfectly and the characters are always memorable.

"4 - 4.5 STARS! 
 Thrilling, sexy, second-chance contemporary sports romance with a twist. Somehow it all works in this perfect summer read! 
 And they would fight to their end for me. This team was my family, my soul. And I think that was what made everything that happened so damn complicated. 
 Tyler has grown up traveling with a baseball team her whole life. Baseball IS her life. She has been home-schooled, innocent, yet stunning and complete unaware of her effect on men. Then baseball's bad boy Chase Stern enters her life. A larger-than-life character, Alessandra Torre could have made him a cliche, but he is deeply sensitive, devoted to the game, and ready to give up his fast-living ways for Ty. 
 Chase Stern. The best bat to hit our game since Barry Bonds. A shortstop who made Ripken look like a rookie. A body built for baseball, a face that made GQ editors swoon, and enough swagger to fill Dodger stands with females. 
 Of course, Ty is forbidden to go near him, she is only 17 at the time and he plays for the team her father works for. But they fall deeply in love with each other, through stolen nights on the baseball field and living life on the road. She knows that he is completely off-limits, but these two share a deep bond that goes beyond the game of baseball. 
 But it wasn't his looks that had sucked me in. It was his play. His effortless grip of a game that we all struggled with. His swing, his throw, the dip of his body when he scooped up a ball, the stretch of his six-foot body when he leapt in the air ... it was my porn. 
 But then...the emotional one-two punch from the author hits and these two are suddenly, irrevocably separated . My heart broke for them!! Flash-forward several years and these two, now adults with their own lives, meet again. I absolutely LOVE second-chance romances, and MOONSHOT has everything I love about this trope. 
 First loves were supposed to be flimsy and temperamental. They were supposed to burn bright and fade fast. They weren't supposed to stick. They weren't supposed to eat away at a man's heart, his capacity for life. 
 Interwoven with this forbidden love story is a thriller aspect which slowly builds toward a terrifying conclusion. Ms. Torre is one of the few authors I know who can perfectly pull off such a clever post twist!! I was totally blindsided by this turn of events and it blended in perfectly with the story. It must be said that the author knows a LOT about the game of baseball and I loved reading about this part of the story, she has fabulous insight in to the game and I almost felt like I was in the stands ready for the players to take the field. MOONSHOT has everything I love about contemporary romance: deeply-felt characters; the sweetness of first love; very adult, steamy love scenes; and the bittersweet pain of second-chance romance. Please keep in mind that there is cheating in this book: this aspect of a story NEVER bothers me or affects my enjoyment of a novel but it is here in MOONSHOT plain and simple. Does it resolve itself? Absolutely. 
 Alessandra Torre is an automatic one-click for me andI loved this story!! Happy reading! 
 Favorite quote: 
 Certain loves can't be fought. The harder you tried, the harder you would be knocked back, over and over again, until it beat you into submission, until your heart caved and body surrendered. Love like that didn't know the rules of society; it didn't care about life mistakes. It only knew what must be, and what would happen--no matter what.

"Smoking hot conclusion to The Player!! Loved it. Filled with warmth, heat and plenty of angst. K. Bromberg is my go-to author for mature, emotional romances about real people dealing with real issues and facing them head-on. And 'The Catch' delivered on all counts. 
 I loved the in-depth look into the sport of baseball (but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!) and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones! The end of 'The Player' was a whopper of a cliffhanger (I won't spoil it here!) and then BOOM! 'The Catch' does a 180 degree turn! 
 I appreciated Easton's POV here and as always, Ms. Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions. Easton is flawed, but he really puts himself out there and his HONESTY is what I loved most about him. Easton and Scout both grew as characters and their love, devotion to family and feelings for each other were absolutely spot-on.",6,4,1,174,71.18,50.33,18.69,94.86,12.43,16.67,83.33,63.79,53.45,9.77,7.47,2.87,0.0,0.57,2.3,1.72,2.3,14.37,8.05,0.57,13.79,5.17,4.6,10.34,1.15,9.2,5.17,4.02,4.02,3.45,0.57,0.0,9.2,1.15,8.05,2.3,0.0,0.57,0.0,2.3,2.3,0.0,9.2,6.9,1.15,5.75,4.02,0.57,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.07,5.17,0.57,0.57,0.0,0.57,0.57,7.47,1.72,0.0,0.57,2.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.87,2.3,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,1.72,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,6.9,9.77,0.57,2.3,4.6,0.57,0.0,2.3,1.72,4.02,3.45,0.57,1.72,1.15,1.15,0.0,0.0,21.26,5.17,2.87,0.0,4.02,4.6,4.6,0
"""You're nothing like I expected."" 
 ""I'm never what anyone expects. It's a blessing and a curse."" 
 YES!! 'The Player' is a sweet-hot sports romance that hits all the bases! The author really knows the game of baseball and it SHOWS. And this might have THE best Dedication Page I've ever read. Ms. Bromberg knocked it out of the park with this story. Even if you're not a fan of sports romance, you'll LOVE this book. Helllloooo, Easton Wylder!! 
 This book is a perfect example of the great things that can come from an author writing what s/he knows. The author's knowledge and understanding of the competitiveness and drive that athletes must have to succeed really shines through in every page. I devoured this smoldering, sexy story and cannot wait for more. There's a cliffhanger but it is not a total shocker, so I am very content to wait for the continuation of Easton and Scout's story. 
 Easton, a brilliant baseball player, is a member of a famed baseball family. He struggles to get back in the game after an injury. And he also struggles to live up to the expectations of his demanding father, a legendary player. 
 Scout knows a thing or two about living up to the family name. Her father is also legendary, a renowned sports medicine figure. And, as a woman working in a male-dominated field, she must constantly fight to prove herself. 
 Easton is her patient but she has ZERO interest in him and knows that is a professional boundary she can never cross. Of course she gets the wrong impression of Easton and stereotypes him as a real ""player"", but once she gets to know the man behind the cocky facade, she is completely surprised. 
 ""He's good with kids. And with dogs. And with his sick mom. And with spooked women. Is there anything this man can do to make me not like him? 
 Because I'm beginning to think he might need to do that, so I don't start believing he hung the moon. Or stole my heart."" 
 The author has a way of creating characters that are memorable, very REAL and very flawed. 'The Player' is without question my favorite book since 'The Driven' series. Easton and Scout are brilliant in their own fields, lonely, driven and afraid to open their hearts. I felt a real connection between the two MC's which is essential to my enjoyment of any romance. This book seems to have been written from straight the heart and has tons of warmth, emotion and of course H-O-T sexy times. 
 Don't wait for 'The Scout' to enjoy this book! A must-read for any contemporary romance lover.

"3.5 Stars 
 The highly-anticipated third book in The Royals Series picks up right where the second book ended so the other books MUST be read in order! While overall I liked the teen-angst feel of this series, the third book felt a bit rushed at times and I felt that Ella and Reed lost some of the heat and passion that fueled the first two books. With that said, this writing duo is very talented and the wild storyline certainly held my interest. 
 In 'Twisted Palace', Ella is firmly in place as a member of the Royals household. Gone is the taunting and name-calling from the first book. Ella and Reed are now completely in love! 
 ""Sometimes I still can't believe that we all hated each other when I first got here. Reed was determined to destroy me. His brothers alternately taunted or ignored me. I fantasized about running away on a daily basis. And now I can't imagine not having the Royals in my life."" 
 Reed has been arrested for the murder of Brooke and the evidence seems pretty strong against him. There are tons of questions in this book. Everyone at school is talking about Reed and giving damaging testimony against him. His past seems to catch up to him and his future looks very grim. Add to that is the fact that Steve is now back! There is TONS of drama plus wild plot twists in this book which makes 'Twisted Palace' feel much more suspenseful than the first two books. I liked the forbidden-love aspect of the earlier books but this book adds almost a mystery element to the series. 
 Reed is loyal to his core. He'd die for his family. 
 Hell, he might've even killed for it. 
 This series is great for readers who love over-the-top drama and first-love stories. I really liked the supporting characters and I hope some of them will get their own story! I also would LOVE a story about Callum Royal. While the brothers don't get as much focus here as in the earlier books, fans of this series will be happy to get more of Reed and Ella. Overall not my favorite in this series but still a fun, light, read that is a total guilty pleasure.

"""It's about what's on the inside. Just like people. Don't you think? It's what's on the inside that really counts."" 
 A Gift of Time is a gift to the readers of the Nine Minutes series. The story flows beautifully through many different time frames, and back and forth between many different points of view. But it all works perfectly and the author has a BIG surprise waiting for fans of this series! 
 I feel that A Gift of Time is, more than any other character's, Ginny's story. If you have read the first two books in the series (and you MUST before reading A Gift of Time), you know that Ginny has been through a lifetime of experiences and has had two great loves in her life. I have always loved both Grizz and Tommy, and I absolutely LOVED how the author resolves the famous Team Grizz/Team Grunt conflict here. This book is told in flashback so all the main characters make an appearance here, all leading toward a fascinating and satisfying conclusion. 
 ""There were just some secrets we had to keep hidden in our hearts to shield those we love."" 
 It is impossible to describe the plot of A Gift of Time without giving anything away. This series is a creative, thrilling, imaginative, beautiful and ultimately uplifting story that I won't soon forget. Grrizz, Grunt and Kit will live on forever! Bravo, Ms. Flynn, for a fantastic conclusion to a terrific series.

"""The dust has settled over the blood we've shed."" 
 Non-stop action, plus tons of graphic violence, a feisty heroine and an ex-con with a soul!! BLOOD TO DUST features a kick-ass heroine, a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying, ""Did I just read that??"" I became a huge fan of LJ Shen's after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beat's story. She is hell-bent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous, corrupt members of a crime family. They have ruined her family, and committed terrible crimes against her. The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them. She is outnumbered and defenseless. And of her captors is Beat. 
 Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive. He owes the a favor to one of the men, the sadistic and all-powerful Godfrey, and Beat (whose real name is Nate) just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible. Nate has committed murder in the past but he won't let any physical harm come to Prescott. As the captor and the captive spend more time together, Prescott and Nate begin to bond. Although he doesn't trust her at first (and rightfully so!), these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts, seek vengeance and maybe, just maybe, find their own brand of happiness. 
 ""We're polar opposites. He's peace looking for color and I'm strorm looking for serenity."" 
 I love dark reads and I really liked this book (the author has a GREAT sense of humor) but felt the story spun out of control in some places. With that being said, Nate Vela is an unforgettable anti-hero!! Sensitive, strong, protective and damaged, I won't soon forget him. And Prescott is one of the strongest, most bad-ass heroines I have ever read. If you love a dark and gritty read, then you will love BLOOD TO DUST. I adore this author and can't wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next!

"4.5 STARS!! 
 ""My name is Jude Nickel, and I am an addict. Also, I'm a big fucking idiot."" 
 I was totally intrigued by Jude in BITTERSWEET, and just knew he had quite a story to tell. The strong, silent type, he was hired to work on the Shipley farm fresh out of prison. And now in STEADFAST, he returns to his hometown and to his alcoholic father to try and rebuild his former life. 
 First, let me just say that the chapter headings in this book are incredible!!! They chronicle the stages of Jude's recovery from drug addiction and are just a fantastic touch. Jude has accepted his reality: he is a recovering drug addict, an ex-con, and will probably never be able to find gainful employment outside his father's run-down auto-repair garage. And he is back in the same town with his first and only love, Sophie, a girl he would have done anything for, until a horrible tragedy ripped them apart. 
 Their love is bittersweet, overwhelming and beautiful. They fell in love as teenagers, and now must try and rebuild their love after several emotional and traumatic years apart. Jude is not your typical ""hero"", as the author reminds us. He is much more!! He is brave, resilient and quite damaged. I have never felt such empathy for a person with a drug addiction as I did for Jude. He is battling daily. And Sophie is right there with him, despite her father's warnings to stay away from Jude. 
 ""The only thing I have ever been afraid of is losing you."" 
 Sarina Bowen has written a very powerful yet sweetly sexy book about second-chance romance. There are some very strong scenes of domestic abuse and family dysfunction in this book, and while some characters rise above this, some do not. BUT it is Jude and Sophie's romance that is at the center of this book. WOW!! Sarina Bowen has shown that she can write fabulous contemporary romances as well as the college romances she is so well known for.

"""When it comes to you, I have an endless supply of sweet, Cassie."" 
 THIS BOOK!! I highlighted so many parts that are SO dirty, they cannot be printed here!! Although part of a series, Cassie and Thatcher's story is a standalone - I did not read the first book and I still loved this one. Banking the Billionaire is a dirty, hilarious romantic comedy, perfect if you are looking for a really sexy, really filthy fast read. 
 Cassie and Thatch are both classic pranksters, so immediately these two try to out-prank each other. Including moving in with each other and getting engaged. But perfectly mixed in with raunchy comedy are some real feelings and great connection with the characters. These two authors have a wicked sense of humor and I found myself thinking, ""Did they actually just write that??"" LOVED these two and their off-the-charts steamy chemistry!! 
 ""Two serial daters with nearly blank relationship histories were engaged. To each other. I'd have been tempted to call an exorcist if I weren't fucking thrilled to be chained to this devil."" 
 This book was much than I was expecting, it's smart, funny, totally raunchy with a fantastic epilogue. I really don't care who Max Monroe is as long as they keep writing these gems!!! 
 She was crazy. 
 Wild. Chaos & beauty. 
 My heart. Mine.

"This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV.

"""It's always been you, and no one else."" 
 WOW!! What a passionate, emotional and sexy story! Love, betrayal, loyalty, forgiveness...this book has it all!! I couldn't put this one down!! I absolutely love enemies-to-lovers books, especially where there is an element of revenge. Plus, I adore Mia Sheridan's writing so I could not wait to read this book. And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover, and this cover is STUNNING. So there's that. 
 I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters. Their pain, suffering, humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again. While Lydia could have been a cookie-cutter, snobby heroine, she instead came across as loyal, loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes. And they were HUGE. A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family. And now he is back in Lydia's life, hell-bent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before. 
 ""Learn from you mistakes, but don't let them define you now. Find forgiveness, for them and for yourself."" 
 Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each other's lives was painful, raw and breathtaking. So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back. There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right. And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous. (Fionn!! HELLO!!) Are there some pieces that don't quite fit together? Yes, but they are non-essential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away. I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it. 
 Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book. What a beautiful and descriptive language! Ms. Sheridan's books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different. I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book. I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he has't quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero, he comes close! Don't miss Ramsay, you will fall i love with these characters, too.

"Villains were created, not born. That was something I'd come to know as a fact. 
 Fans of the Rosemary Beach series will love this book. I have read most of the books in this series and have loved some more than others, and in Up In Flames, Abbi Glines throws in lots of surprises! This book is VERY different from the other books in the series!! I was so excited for Nan's book and to see how in the world the author was going to redeem this very unloveable, vengeful character. And she did it!! 
 Nan has been the villain in this series, cold, spiteful and generally a bad person. The only person who ever seemed to care for her was her brother Rush. I devoured this book in one sitting daily because of Gannon. OMG is he hot!! There are two men vying for Nan's heart in this book and I was so glad I didn't read any spoilers. The author surprised me here with some very wild and explicit sex scenes. I also loved how Nan seemed to finally make peace with her family, especially with those she has been so cruel to in the past. And yes, Nanette does get her happy ending!!! This is a sexy, fast-paced read, perfect for a summer beach read. Lots of surprises in this one. Thanks, Abbi, for finally making Nan into a character I could actually care about!

"3.5 - 4 Stars! 
 This was my first book by Rachel Blaufeld and it did not disappoint. To See You has a totally captivating storyline and a VERY lovable hero. The heroine? Not so much! I applaud the author for giving us a very different hero and writing a very realistic and fast-paced story. 
 I loved the clever structure of this story, and the way the description of Charli and Layton's first meeting and developing relationship unfolds. Layton just grabbed my heart. Charli is a difficult heroine to like, let alone love, but it was refreshing to read about an very imperfect main character. 
 This is a very heartfelt story, and I don't think I have ever read a book that featured an overweight hero. But Layton is a wonderful person with a huge heart and he really evolves over the course of the story. Their banter is clever and the settings are interesting. I will definitely read more from this author!

"4.5 - 5 Riveting Stars! 
 ""Do you hate your husband?"" 
 ""I never hated him."" 
 ""You're about to."" 
 Nuanced, layered and intriguing, I loved everything about this book!! A must-read. 
 Adam Steinbeck has just been dealt a blow. His beloved wife Diana is leaving him. Partners in business and in life, he is in total shock. His emotions are raw, exposed and real. He doesn't know what to do or how to make things right again. He cannot live without Diana. 
 ""The first time I saw her, I had to hold my breath. The first time she spoke, I exhaled."" 
 But Adam has been living a lie with his wife. He never revealed to her who he really was. A Dominant. He gave it all up for her, and now he realizes that she must have sensed he was holding something back from her, never fully giving himself to her. 
 Perfect Diana...What would I do to posses her? Would I change my cellular structure? Turn my back on my identity? Walk away from it, never talk about it, burn it so thoroughly into a pile of dust that not telling her wouldn't be a lie? 
 This raw and powerful book alternates between past and present so we really get a sense of the shared history between Adam and Diana. This story rockets towards a breathtaking conclusion as only CD Reiss can do. Her writing is crisp, clear, intelligent and very, very sensual. The depth of Adam's love for his wife is almost palpable and he will not let her walk away without a fight. And so she agrees to his detailed plan to spend 30 days alone together, away from their business in New York City. Adam is going to show Diana who he really is. The stakes are high but Adam plays to win. 
 ""I can only breathe if I know she's there. I gave her my f*king soul and she threw it away. Months ago, maybe years ago. She made a decision to throw me away. She's prepared for this divorce, and I'm swinging in the wind. Raw. With nothing. No defenses. Now what am I supposed to do?"" 
 I could not breathe while I was reading this book!! It is incredibly sexy, thought-provoking and emotional. I loved every word. The ending was nothing short of shocking and I'm counting the days until the second book!!

"""You kidnapping me?"" 
 ""Only a little."" 
 I have heard amazing things about the first two books in this series so I couldn't wait to read I Everything I Left Unsaid. I did NOT feel lost reading this book even though I had not read the first two books. Max and June/Olivia are two incredible characters , and the writing is crisp, clean, intense and INCREDIBLY sexy. 
 June has a sister who is being held against her will by a cult. She dreams up a wild plan to rescue her which does not go according to plan and she ends up wounding and kidnapping Max, a dangerous MC President. Olivia is crazy about Max but he is a very dangerous man and can't be trusted. She brings him to her estranged aunt's house to recuperate from his wounds. The scenes in Florida at Aunt Fern's condo are priceless. And the slow burn starts to build between Olivia and Max, both damaged people who have led pretty sad and lonely lives. 
 ""Mutual assured destruction. You and I have sex, get involved in that way...both us burn. Both of us. We'll tear each other apart until there's nothing left to walk away from."" 
 Olivia is a loner and doesn't dare dream of ever being happy. She makes sure to sabotage anything good that comes into her life. The story itself is gritty, somewhat dark and definitely NOT your typical contemporary romance. There is no insta-love, and it takes quite a while for those two to get together. This book is VERY steamy and includes a sexy F/F scene that is incredibly hot. But the action, the scenes between Max and Olivia and the swoony scenes that eventually happened between Max and Olivia were all absolutely perfect. There is a wonderful Epilogue and I loved the conclusion that Ms. O'Keefe gave to these very troubled characters.

"This book hits all the high notes! I LOVED it. Small town, second-chance romance; main characters dealing with both mental and physical pain; and an excruciatingly emotional event that changes all of their lives forever. 
 ""It takes courage to love. But to have someone to love and to love you back is worth every bump in the road."" 
 Grab a box of tissues because you will need one for this story!! 
 'Written in the Scars' was a very emotional and ultimately heartwarming story of finding and keeping your one true soul mate. It was difficult to see how Elin and Ty were not together after all they had been through and the deep love they obviously carried for each other. Ty had suffered through a terrible trauma, and this very fast-paced book kept me turning the pages to see where their story would go. 
 ""I miss her,"" I sigh. ""No matter what I try to think about, it's related to her. High school. The mine. The lake."" My jaw clenches as I look at him. ""Our lives are one and the same, you know? Everything we've been through in our lives we've done together. I held her hand at your parent's funeral, remember your mom's lemon pie every time I go through the produce section. I know she hates storms and love being there for her when she reaches out."" 
 ""So fix it."" 
 I absolutely loved Elin's and Ty's circle of family and friends. I felt as though they were real people, and I felt their joy and their pain. 'Written in the Scars' is a good, old-fashioned, blue-collar small-town romance which is a wonderful change of pace from many contemporary romances out today. If you've never read a book by Adriana Locke, I highly recommend starting with this one (although I loved 'The Exception', too!). Elin and Ty's story is loving, sexy, heartbreaking at times but ultimately incredibly uplifting. 
 ""You know, it's better to have a scar than a bruise.""

"""You and I are okay. We will always be okay, no matter what happens."" 
 Once again, exceptional writing and gorgeous, erotic sex scenes from Nina Lane. The subject matter was painful to read about, but Liv and Dean are by far one of my favorite fictional couples. And Dean is the real deal. 
 This series is one of THE most beautifully written erotic romances I have ever read. In Always, things take a dark turn for this amazing couple and their family. Woven in with the almost-magical existence in Mirror Lake are some grueling scenes that would test even the strongest of marriages. Professor Dean West is the most devoted husband and father ever. Olivia has matured into a strong, caring and capable woman who is also devoted to her adorable children, Bella and Nicholas. 
 I adore this series and the unforgettable Dean West. He is such a strong presence in this book, and the cast of supporting characters are all incredible. I love Archer!! He is an incredible brother to Dean. There are lots of tears in this book but also lots of happiness and intensely beautiful, sexy moments. In this final book in the Spiral of Bliss series, marriage is the center of the story, and Always shows what a talented and gifted writer Nina Lane is. Fans of this series will love Liv and Dean's happily ever after! 
 ""I love you like milk loves honey,"" she says. 
 I brush my lips across her cheek. ""I love you like Dean loves Liv.""

"4.5 STARS! 
 ""He changed the story."" 
 Hellloooo, Damien!! I LOVED this very funny, passionate and emotional story from the fabulous Penelope Ward!!! Having read STEPBROTHER DEAREST, I could not WAIT to dive into this story. BUT even though that is one of my favorite books, and I highly recommend it, you do NOT have to read it first. 
 Chelsea has been left completely brokenhearted by her ex, Elec. She thought he was the ""one"". He declared his devotion to her and she thought they would grow old together. But it was just not meant to be. Chelsea moves into a new apartment in a new neighborhood to escape the memories of her old life. At first it seems as though her HOT new neighbor Damien can't stand her, but then they begin to build a fantastic friendship that turns oh-so-slowly into a gorgeous romance. 
 Damien is a brilliant artist who also happens to own the building where Chelsea lives. He has two Rottweilers who play a big part of this story and who are one of the reasons why Damien and Chelsea meet and get off to a rocky start to begin with. There's lots more to Damien then meets the eye, and learning about him is part of the wonderful experience of reading this book. 
 Chelsea is extremely insecure after being suddenly dumped by Elec, and Damien's compliments and the way he sees her really help to boost her confidence. She is wildly attracted to Damien but he makes it clear she is in the friend-zone. But why can't they be more than just friends?? Has his heart been broken, too? What secret is he hiding?? 
 ""I looked closer at what I'd messaged him and realized it hadn't come through the way I'd intended. the auto correct had actually changed the message to: Wanna duck? Great. That was smooth."" 
 Damien is the whole package: smart, hot, loving, sweet, attentive...but why is he constantly pushing Chelsea away? 
 ""You're in my heart and I can't get you out. I don't know if I want to. Being with you is the only thing that feels right."" 
 NEIGHBOR DEAREST is a VERY sexy, character-driven book that is totally readable and perfectly swoony. Ms. Ward has created another unforgettable book boyfriend with Damien. The supporting characters are all fantastic. And I absolutely LOVED the message of this book: things happen for a reason and just because someone leaves you, it doesn't mean that you can't find happiness again. *SIGH* 
 ""You know why it didn't work out with him?"" 
 ""Why?"" 
 ""Because God made you for me.""

"""All she sees is what's right in front of her. Guys are drawn to her, because of her spirit and smiles. She's a happy person, and she makes people feel good when they're around her. I'm not like that. I'm just kind of there. Like empty space."" 
 If Penelope Douglas writes a book, I will read it! And this series is one of my favorites, so I could not wait to get back into these characters' lives! And what a treat! Once again, Ms. Douglas surprises and puts a fresh spin on her beloved characters. This book introduces us to Quinn, but also sets up the next generation of characters and it was just a pleasure to read. 
 The author uses a story within a story here which added a layer of nuance and depth to what I thought would be a classic New Adult romance. Ms. Douglas gives us the backstory of Katherine Trent and Jason Caruthers and it broke my heart! Yes, you will absolutely need to read the other books in the series first but Bully and the later books are among my most cherished stories. From adult contemporary romance to new adult stories, Ms. Douglas can do it all. 
 ""Why did you marry her?"" she asked me in return. 
 I turned my eyes back out to the road as I would my way through her neighborhood. 
 Because I didn't see you first. 
 My heart!! The author does a wonderful job of telling two parallel stories here. The book felt a little sad to me at times because of the theme of lost time but the author gives her characters the perfect conclusion here. Don't miss Next to Never! It is a clever love letter to the fans of the Fall Away Series.

"""Open your shirt for me, little one. Let's see if I like what I'm getting for my trouble."" 
 She's baaaaack!! Penelope Douglas has written another dark and delicious and riveting story in the Devil's Night series. I could not WAIT for Kai's story and it was everything I hoped for! Secrets are revealed, inner desires unleashed with a heart-pounding romance at the heart of to all. 
 Kai's story was incredible. Ms. Douglas is one of the most talented romance writers around and I just knew that she would create another romantic suspense story like no other. 'Hideaway' is just as dark os 'Corrupt' and will satisfy your every craving. Kai is an alpha like no other - dark, dangerous and SMART. 
 ""We're only ever good, because there are consequences,"" I told her. ""Take those away, and everyone shows their true self. Kind of like taking off a mask."" 
 This book alternates back and forth between the present and Devil's Night six years before. Kai has finally met his match in Banks, a mysterious figure who may or may not have some connection to him. The chemistry between them is perfect, as I would expect with a Penelope Douglas book, but not instant. They have an intense and sexy connection but to say more would ruin the experience of reading this story. I am glad I did not know too much about the plot. It was INSANE!! 
 ""Happy to hear it, because I'm the only man whose attention you should be trying to get, and baby, you got it years ago while wearing another man's clothes."" He kissed my temple, his hot breath sending chills down my spine. ""So you can imagine how fucking beautiful you are to me right now wearing mine."" 
 There are tons of twists and turns and part of the enjoyment of reading this yummy tale was the ending. This book is definitely for fans of dark romance: this is not a hearts-and-flowers kind of book. But if you are a fan of the Four Horsemen from 'Corrupt', then you will devour 'Hideaway'! It is raw and gritty and WILD. And there is a fabulous sneak peek from 'Kill Switch', Devil's Night #3. I can't wait to see how Ms. Douglas tells Damon's story!!

"4.5 STARS! 
 WOW!! What an emotional roller coaster ride! LAST TOUCH is a totally hot and sexy conclusion with a fantastic psychological-thriller aspect. Laurelin Paige once again shows her incredible talent for creating nuanced characters and dominating, irresistible heroes. 
 The ending of the first book was SUCH a cliffhanger, that I could not WAIT to get my hands on the second book in this series!! And LAST KISS does not disappoint. Laurelin Paige writes very adult, very sexy books and she kept me guessing throughout this whole story. Emily is insatiable for Reeve in this book and their chemistry burns up the pages. 
 God, I was hungry for him. I roved my hands over his chest, wanting to touch all of his body at once, delighting at the hard muscles that met the underside of my palms. He was solid everywhere. A wall of strength and potency that could so easily overpower me. I was weak in his presence, incapable of anything except to yield. 
 I loved Reeve Sallis from the beginning of this series (weird, I know!) and I adored his uber-Alpha ways. He obviously loves Emily but his loyalties are called into question here. There are tons of surprises in this book so I can't say anything about the plot in case you haven't read the first book in the series (which I HIGHLY recommend!!) These two are on absolutely FIRE when they are together. These are two adults who have lived through a lot and Emily might have finally found someone with who she can be completely herself. 
 He leaned his hip against the vanity and folded his arms across his chest, a position that highlighted both his broad shoulders and toned biceps. ""You like it when I keep you guessing,"" he said dismissively, not an entirely inaccurate statement, though it was a bit discomforting that he knew it so well. ""And I like you on your toes,"" he added, his eyes dark as they slid the length of my body. 
 LAST KISS is a super-sexy, romantic suspense that rockets toward a riveting conclusion. I could not put this book down!! Laurelin Paige is on my short list of must-read authors and she kept me on my toes throughout this whole book. The sexy times are TOTALLY hot, believable, adult and very raw. There are many characters that kept me second-guessing the plot and I certainly did not see this ending coming. Who was the bad guy? Was there even a bad guy in this story? You must read this book to find out!! 
 A warning bell sounded in the back of my head, though, urging me to get my wits together and address . . . something. It was dificult to remember what exactly when his hands were on my breasts, squeezing and pinching. The bite of pain sent jolts of electricity through my nervous system, signals that my brain read as pleasure. Pleasure I couldn't resist. 
 If you are a fan of sexy, suspenseful stories with an irresistible, Alpha male and a very strong heroine, then I highly recommend this series. You won't be able to put these books down!

"I am finishing up dinner with my family and my fiance when my husband calls. 
 What an opening line!! What would you do if the person you loved and thought was gone, suddenly re-appeared in your life, after you had moved on? This is the center of Taylor Jenkins Reid's fantastic new novel, ONE TRUE LOVES. From this powerful beginning, this story follows Emma as she must reconcile finding her long-lost first love with her new life and her new fiance, Sam. 
 Emma and Jesse had been crazy in love and absolutely devoted to each other. They met as teenagers and ended up married and moving away from their small New England town to California. A tragic accident takes Jesse away, and after an agonizing period of mourning, Emma finds herself opening up to the possiblity of loving another man again. 
 I think that perhaps everyone has a moment that splits their life in two. When you look back on your own timeline, there's a sharp spike somewhere along the way, some event that changed you, changed your life, more than the others. A moment that creates a ""before"" and an ""after."" 
 Told from Emma's POV, this book tells the story of how Emma and Jesse first fell in love. The author does an amazing job of creating very memorable characters who seemed very real. I felt like I knew Emma, Jesse and Sam and their friends and families. It is very important for me to feel connected to the main characters and I absolutely connected with all of the characters in this book. I loved how Emma grew and matured throughout this book and how her relationships with those around her changed and evolved as well. 
 Good things don't wait until you're ready. Sometimes they come right before, when you're almost there. And I figured when that happens, you can let them pass by like a bus not meant for you. Or you can get ready. So I got ready. 
 I cannot think of enough to say about this gorgeous book!! Emma, Jesse and Sam's story is so totally engrossing, you will feel like you are reading about your good friends. I cared deeply about what was going to happen to these three and was completely blown away by the direction this book took. This is a richly written, detailed story about first love, family, friendship and growing up. The ending is enormously satisfying and I found myself re-reading passages this book after I finished. I was not ready to say goodbye to these characters! ONE TRUE LOVES is certainly one of the best books of the year and one of new top favorite books ever. Don't miss this one!!

 I don't think that true love means your only love.

"Ahhh, is there anything sweeter than second-chance love? I think not! K. Bromberg once again delivers with this sexy-sweet, second-chance love story with all new characters. The settings, the story, the characters...I simply fell in love with Hayes and Saylor!! 
 The author is one of my top go-to contemporary romance authors and 'Sweet Cheeks' is a perfect example of her easy, romantic and sexy writing style. 
 Saylor recently called off her engagement and is shocked when she receives an invitation to her former fiancee's wedding. She is a smart, driven businesswoman who owns her own bakery. What is she to do? While not one to engage in unnecessary drama, she finds herself in an unusual ""situation"" after her assistant accidentally replies that she will be attending the wedding. With a guest! 
 She is convinced to attend the destination wedding and to bring as her ""plus-1"" her old love, Hayes Whitely. Oh but guess what: he is now a Hollywood superstar, having abandoned Saylor years ago without a word when he left for Hollywood. Why on earth would she even consider this crazy idea?! But Hayes is VERY convincing and off they go to the tropics. A part of Saylor does want to show off to her ex, but she realizes that she could wind up getting her heart stomped on in a big way. 
 Hayes may be a well-known actor, but Saylor was his true love. Can he ever make amends for what he did, and win back Sailor's trust? And love? 
 Even at the age of seventeen, Hayes could kiss in a way that made me feel like I'd just laid every part of my soul on the line when his lips left mine.

"Well, well! The writing in 'The Deep End' is VERY different from other Kristen Ashley books but not to fear, the author turns the heat WAY up in this book. I'll be honest, I had to think about this story for a while after I finished reading it. 
 I loved the plot of this book. The heroine Amelia is a Domme and is very accepting of herself and her needs. She was unapologetic about her lifestyle and for that, I applaud the author. In many other ways, she was just a normal human being with a desire to build a relationship with someone outside the BDSM scene and club life. 
 Amelia is a member of the ultra-exclusive club The Bee's Honey. They have a very rigorous screening process and she knows the men she will meet will have to pass certain requirements before they can walk in the door. She has never quite met the ""perfect"" sub but once she sets her sights on Olivier, all bets are off. He's her dream man, an Alpha sub who can meet her every need. He is everything I love about a KA hero: strong, confident, loving and caring. I had a bit of difficulty with their dynamic because he didn't seem like he was really a true submissive but their relationship worked. Olivier and Amelie didn't have a ""typical"" D/s relationship (if there even is such a thing) but they both seemed perfect for each other. 
 I am a diehard Kristen Ashley fan so I will read anything this woman writes. I LOVED the erotic aspects of this story and the BDSM scenes did not offend me at all. I think that KA writes some very explicit sex scenes but 'The Deep End' is VERY explicit!! If you are a fan of this author's books, then definitely give this one a try. It is different and intriguing and has some very unique characters. Just be prepared to be surprised. Enjoy!!

"""My heart beats with yours. Wake up to hear my heart one day. This day. Every day."" 
 All the stars for 'An Exaltation of Larks'!! My words cannot do justice to this epic story. A richly woven tale of love, family, marriage, sex, loyalty and friendship. Not to be missed! 
 At its core, this book is the story of three intertwined lives: Javier, Alex and Val. The author paints an incredibly detailed portrait of their lives, following them through their childhoods and later on into adulthood, complete with families, relationships, broken hearts and very rich, full lives. 
 Alex comes to live with the Lark family as a child, orphaned by the terrible war in Chile. He is taken into this big, beautiful family. His childhood memories never, ever fade and continue to haunt him the rest of his life. 
 ""As images of Chile faded and curled at the edges, the photo album in Alex's heart began to fill with new family snapshots, all with his sleek, dark physique set like a black iris in the Lark bouquet of daffodils."" 
 Constantly fighting and arguing as children, Alex and Valerie Lark later fall madly and passionately in love. Their love is a tight bond that cannot be broken and they are each other's soulmates. 
 ""Seeing her was a key turned in a rusty lock and now all his gears were churning. She'd been the missing link around here. Hers was the action he craved, the fight his nails wanted to dig into. He couldn't wait to talk and tell stories, to laugh and tease, to bash the bathroom door down and push every button. Val was home, and it was on, baby."" 
 Parallel to their story is Javier's, whose teen years are painful and terrible and traumatic. But he carves a life for himself as a young man, a lonely and loveless one until his path crosses with Alex and Val's. Their lives become intertwined in many different ways. Their experiences are skillfully woven together by the author through many years and many life-changing events. Every page, every word in this story is meaningful, perfect and beautiful. 
 This gorgeous story proves how fluid and unpredictable and messy love can be. The bonds of friendship, family and marriage are tested. When Javier's path crosses again with the Larks decades after they first meet, no one's life will ever be the same. 
 ""The sunlight through the glass intensified and Jav remembered this was a woman who kicked in the bathroom door to get back what was hers. He imagined Alex came to America with a half-dozen barricaded doors in his heart, and Val either bashed them down, took them off the hinges or picked the locks open. She'd let nothing come between her and her man."" 
 I think I highlighted this entire book. Suanne Laqueur's words haunted me and I can't stop thinking about this book. I think Javier might be one of the most heartbreaking characters I have ever encountered. He has built a fortress around his heart and all I wanted was for him was to love and be loved. 
 ""Let me come in. Let me stay. Let me touch you. I want to come home and talk about it."" 
 I never imagined in a million years that I would love a book as much as 'The Man I Love'. Suanne Laqueur has written another epic story of love, sex, friendship, romance and family that is simply breathtaking. This book spoke to me on so many different levels! It is not to be missed.

"What a sexy, romantic, heart-stopping story!! Reggie is not your average contemporary romance hero. He has some serious anxiety issues which are described perfectly by M. Mabie. She writes a male POV like nobody's business! Reggie must have control always BUT he must also go very slowly when it comes to the gorgeous and elusive Nora. She is defintiely NOT looking for love, or even for a relationship. Instead, she practices a poly lifestyle, only interested in threesomes or multiple lovers at the same time. She is quite clear about this from the beginning and it provided quite a twist to this book. 
 Call them swingers. Call them poly. Call them whatever you like. People with our preferences found other people who liked the same things. 
 How would Reggie ever break through Nora's self-professed lifestyle? This book is told in flashbacks and you must pay attention to the words to get the most out this story. Yes, there is lots of emotion and angst but the clever story line makes it well worth it. These two characters are very strong, driven, smart and successful. Nora is from a wealthy family but works very hard at her business. Reggie is brilliant and driven and can only think about Nora. Their scenes together are SPECTACULAR! But will their chemistry be enough to hold them together? 
 I absolutely loved how open Reggie was with Nora. He began to fall in love with her and he laid his cards out on the table. Nora and Reggie were obviously perfect for each other but it took SO much for them to finally realize it at the same time. They were incomplete without each other; but miserable when they were together. 
 ""When did we stop telling the truth?"" I asked and took the towel she handed me. The moment held so much levity. There we were naked and clean, but still hiding behind excuses. 
 ""When we fell in love,"" she answered. ""I guess when you have something worth lying for, you'll lie to protect it. Even if it is just to yourself."" 
 The dialogue is sharp and witty and the plot is incredibly clever. I fell in love with Reggie. I actually really liked Nora and loved her sharp tongue. I read Knot in one sitting; it is a very sexy, surprising and emotional story that is well worth the journey Reggie and Nora take. The alternating flashbacks which lead up to the present time were perfect for this story. I won't soon forget these characters! Bravo to M. Mabie for a fantastic read!

"""Maybe I was a fool. I probably was. But the thing with love was that once you felt it, it was impossible to turn off."" 
 *Sigh* INTO THE BLUE was swoony, sexy and intelligent...I absolutely LOVE the heroes of the Wild Aces series!! This was a sweet and steamy story with TONS of heat and heart. 
 A lovely second-chance romance, Eric (aka Thor) swoops back into the small town he grew up in. He is taking some time off to recover from a traumatic event and can't help but pursue his first love, Becca. She is now a successful attorney, and Eric was the boy who broke her heart into a million pieces when he left to pursue a military career. 
 What I love about this author is that her heroines are smart, grown-up professional women. Becca has her own life and her own career, and makes it very clear to Eric that she can't transfer all over the world with him because that would mean starting all over in each location by having to take the Bar exam. 
 I love this bit of realism injected into an otherwise sexy and romantic story! It made Eric and Becca's choices all the more bittersweet. But Eric...can I just discuss these Wild Aces men for a minute? Intelligent, with model good-looks and fierce loyalty, they have it all!! How could Becca resist? 
 ""Give me a chance,"" I whispered against her mouth. ""Please."" 
 She stilled and I waited, everything hanging on her answer. 
 ""Maybe."" 
 Chanel Cleeton's books are smart, bittersweet, sexy...but never artificially sweet or sappy. INTO THE BLUE is a fabulous summer read filled with strong characters and totally steamy chemistry. Yes, there is some heartache and regret but the ending is perfect for these two characters. Each book is a standalone but I highly recommend book #1 because it is just as sexy and smart as INTO THE BLUE. And up next? Easy's story! I can already tell my heart will be aching!!

 ""How long does it take to fall in love? A second? A week? A year? It's like asking how long it takes to fall asleep. Some people are gone as soon as their head hits the pillow. Others lie awake for hours, and it's only when their brain stops churning for a while that sleep sneaks in and drags them under. That's how I visualize people falling in love. Some people fall so easily, they seem reckless. They love freely and unashamed. Those people are idiots. Or at least I used to think so. Until now."" 
 GAH!!! MY HEART!! Wicked Heart is the story of Elissa (who is Ethan's sister from Bad Romeo & Broken Juliet). One night, she happens to run into Liam Quinn, and he steals her heart. But fate has other plans for these two, and sadly, Elissa finds herself without Liam, and clueless as to why he disappeared from her life. Flash-forward years later and Elissa and Liam are working on the same stage production. Excerpt now, Liam is a superstar and has an equally famous fiance. 
 Elissa is a professional and as stage manager, she is not allowed to become involved with any to the actors on the production. Liam broke her heart years before and she is trying her best not to let his new relationship crush her again. Liam still cares about her but being ""just friends"" with him might be too painful for her already fragile heart. 
 ""Friends"" is one of those terms that seems benign but has a whole host of barbed-wire boundaries. Once you've made love to someone with so much passion that his name is branded on all your cells, is it possible to ever think of him as just a friend? Or is the heat of on old flame always going to lie dormant, just waiting to consume you again?"" 
 But just you don't think this book is all angst, Leisa Rayven writes incredibly witty and funny dialogue to lighten up the mood. I found myself swooning, laughing AND crying while reading Wicked Heart!! 
 A shudder of pleasure runs up my spine. ""Oh, I wouldn't dream of destroying such perfection. Are those hospital corners?"" ""If you find that sexy, then yes."" I let out a soft groan. ""Such a turn-on."" He chuckles, thinking I'm teasing, but I'm really not. I'm a self-confessed neat freak, and knowing he keeps a tidy house makes me all kinds of hot. ""Well, if you're finished eye-fucking my bed,"" he says, ""I have something else to show you."" ""If it's a recently cleaned bathroom, I don't think my body's ready."" 
 This book is filled with sexual tension, heat, humor and heartache. The author's writing is so beautiful that I was swept away while reading this book. While I recommend reading the fantastic Bad Romeo and Broken Juliet before reading Wicked Heart, it is not necessary in order to enjoy this story. Oh and did I mention that I LOVE Liam? Favorite quote: 
 ""Stay the night,"" he says quietly. ""I want to see how many more times I can make you scream before morning.""

 ""You are important, and you can't be replaced. Hang on."" 
 NO ONE writes dark and edgy young adult books like Penelope Douglas! I LOVE the message of this sexy and angsty book. Ryen and Misha are unforgettable! 
 Even if you aren't a fan of YA books, 'Punk 57' has enough adult scenes and intense sexual chemistry to satisfy. This is what keeps me coming back again and again to this author's books. Yes, there are tons of tough scenes; especially hard to take are the painful scenes from high school. Not pretty. This book is somewhat dark and angsty and is almost a hybrid between 'Corrupt' and the 'Fall Away' series. 
 This is a classic love/hate/love story. Both characters were pen pals from a young age, pouring their hearts out to each other in a series of letters written over the years. They felt that they could only be themselves with the other; and they each brought out the best in the other. However, they have sworn to be anonymous, pledging to not seek the other out on social media. So when Ryen meets Misha in person for this first time, she has no idea who he is. Misha has been in love with Ryen for years but he hates the person she is now. Or who he ASSUMES she is. 
 ""And then when I found out she was popular, not an outcast, and a cardboard cut-out, not at all original, I became angry. She led me to believe those things, and my muse was a lie."" 
 Yes, you must suspend disbelief for a minute here to believe that two teenagers in 2016 could really stay oblivious to the other's true identity. BUT there is so much nuance to this story and so many twists and turns that I could go along with that part of the story. 
 How do you tell your friend-- your best friend-- that you've been right here, under her nose, playing with her like a puppet? 
 'Punk 57' is raw and BRUTALLY honest. Ultimately, it delivers an uplifting, beautiful and important message to anyone with a negative self-image or low self-esteem. And for that, I applaud the author. 
 ""They'll never matter to us, Ryen. 
 No one knows how this feels.""

"4 - 4.5 Stars! 
 Sexy, sweet, and heartwarming with some very witty moments. My first Lex Martin book and I loved it! You can absolutely read Shameless as a standalone, even though Brady appeared in Finding Dandelion. Shameless has heart, characters I connected with and wonderful supporting characters. Brady is a tattoo artist who happens to have a Fine Arts degree and also rides a Harley. He travels from Boston to his brother's farm in Texas after a sudden tragedy to take over the care of his baby niece. I was already swooning before I even got to the baby part. 
 ""Here is this hot man, tattoos decorating his rugged arms, muscles tugging at the fabric, asking me about the baby's binkie while he holds her close to his chest."" 
 Katherine is helping with the care of the baby and staying on the farm after the sudden loss of her best friend. She is nerdy but beautiful and sweet and Brady is very attracted to her. He is drawn to her kindness and devotion to the baby and the farm. And when he learns about her background...well, his heart and my heart broke for her! She had a very tough childhood but attended college on a full scholarship. She is hard-working and humble but Brady thinks they can never be in a committed relationship. He needs to go back to Boston and Katherine has roots in Texas . Plus they are both dealing with loads of grief and guilt. Not the best time to fall in love. 
 It is very hard for a writer to create a connection between her characters and the reader but Lex Martin has done an outstanding job with this in Shameless. I really cared about Katherine and Brady and what would happen to their new ""family"" and to blossoming their relationship. Shameless is swoony and passionate and funny and sexy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Texas Hill Country setting. 
 This was a solid romantic read for me, with all the right elements. Brady was tender, sexy, and hot; Katherine was funny, smart, sexy and strong. I am still thinking about these characters days after finishing the book, which is always a good sign for me. I can't wait to go through my Kindle and read Lex martin's other books!

"4 -4.5 Twisted Stars!! 
 ""I could be whatever I wanted beneath him."" 
 WOW!! What a dark and delicious ride. NOT for everyone but I loved it. 
 Nikki Sloane is a writer of very erotic and sexy stories. I have enjoyed her earlier books so I was very intrigued when she announced she was writing a dark romance. SORDID is very different from her earlier books and features a shy, somewhat nerdy, smart heroine. Addison goes to a frat party where she meets up with her crush, Luka, a teaching assistant from one of her math classes. Addison is insecure and socially awkward, and wants to ""let go"" for once in her life. She has too much to drink at the party and ends up with Luka. 
 The story then takes a 180 degree turn and Luka turns out to be extremely dangerous and controlling. He literally captures Addison and wont let her go. SORDID contains scenes of non-consensual sex so if this is a trigger for you, do not read this book. Luka is sexy and desirable BUT he is also cruel and abusive toward Addison at the beginning of this story. Nikki Sloane redeems him a little by the end of the book, which also has undertones of romantic suspense, but this is a very, very dark book. With that said, the sex scenes are also incredibly hot and erotic and the story is very fast-paced and surprising. 
 ""His reality is cruel and dark. He traps me in his web, his power twisting tighter the more I struggle, until it's hopeless. I can't break free."" 
 This is an edgy, graphic story with a fascinating cast of characters. Luka's motivations are revealed by the end of the story but we never really know what he is thinking because the book is told from Addison's POV. I loved how she stayed strong throughout this story, even as she was incredibly conflicted about her feelings toward Luka. Their relationship was certainly non-traditional for sure, but it somehow worked for me. Luka had a raw appeal and accepted what kind of person he was. SORDID is not the most graphic or taboo book I have ever read but it is close. Nikki Sloane is a gifted writer and my only issue with the book is that I would have liked a little more written about Luka's family! So hopefully another book will be coming that will explain more about his very dangerous family. 
 SORDID is a rough and raw read, but fans of dark erotic romance will love this one. There is a ton of very, very graphic sex in this book. But any book that makes me think about the characters after I have finished is a winner, and trust me, Luka is a VERY memorable character! 
 ""I control every part of you. Repeat it."" I was trembling in my core. Instinctively I wanted to fight against him, but I also wanted to please. I wanted to succeed. I stumbled over the words. ""You control every part of me.""

"Raine Miller has written another swoony, sexy, and beautiful story!! I fell in LOVE with Caleb! 
 I couldn't wait to read this new series from Raine Miller. Loosely connected to the Blackstone Affair series, the new Blackstone Dynasty introduces Caleb Blackstone, a wealthy businessman who is handsome, brilliant, driven, and of course, all alone. His life is filled with one-night stands and no permanence. He neither has the time or the interest in a lasting relationship. His family is wealthy and he does seems to have it all. Raine Miller writes an Alpha male like nobody's business and you can add Caleb Balckstone to the short list of handsome, passionate heroes. 
 Yes, there is some insta-love here BUT Raine Miller is a masterful writer and takes time to build her characters. When Caleb first sees the pretty Brooke, he smitten. Their later chance encounter at a party leaves a lasting impression on him. Little does he know that their families actually share a long history together. But Brooke, who is working several jobs, has ZERO interest in a serious relationship. She has suffered great loss in her life and was forced to leave her home England at a young age to live with her grandmother in America. Caleb and Brooke are both totally blind-sided by their mutual attraction. 
 ""Nothing was familiar when it came to Brooke. Each new thing we shared together felt to me as if I'd never done it before, and more importantly, as if I never wanted to do it again with anyone other than her--ever."" 
 I loved how Ms. Miller touched on the loneliness that both of her main characters felt. It was very poignant and made Caleb and Brooke's growing relationship all the more sweeter. I also adored how devoted Caleb was to Brooke and their passion together was INCREDIBLE! If you are looking for a beautifully written contemporary romance that is fairly low on the drama and angst, then 'Filthy Rich' is for you. The author made the New England setting come alive for me and I absolutely ADORE the cover of this book. The cover model Adam Cowie is THE perfect Caleb Blackstone. 
 While this book is a standalone, there will be another book coming in this series in February of 2017 for more about the Blackstone family! 
 ""When you find whatever it is that makes you happy, Caleb, hold on to it with everything you've got. Your heart will let you know.""

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Thank you, Joanna Wylde, for the fabulous Tinker Garrett!! She's a smart, feisty, funny heroine who isn't 20 years old. And Gage...HOLY HOTNESS!! Gage and Tinker's story was a hot and sweet slow burn romance, with the perfect amount of humor, depth and emotion. 
 I read a lot of MC stories and Joanna Wylde remains one of the best writers in this genre. The Reapers is one of my favorite MC series and I knew from the first few pages that this would be an exciting, witty and sexy story. 
 Gage is above all else loyal to his club. He hates his current undercover assignment, mainly because he has a fake girlfriend which is stopping him from claiming the stunning Tinker. The Club always comes before all else. 
 ""Reapers forever, forever Reapers. 
 Sometimes loyalty sucks."" 
 Tinker Garrett is certainly not Gage's usual ""type"" - she is smart, runs a thriving business, owns her own home and is taking care of her elderly father. Not the usual young girls Gage toys with. And I absolutely adored Tinker's best friend!! But Gage soon realizes he could have something real and beautiful with Tinker and he sets out to claim what's his. 
 I turned, catching the back of her head and pulling her in for a hard kiss, because fuck loyalty. 
 There is a lot going on in this book plot-wise, no question. But Ms. Wylde ties everything together AND really makes you CARE about the main characters. As always, the Washington State setting is perfect and well-researched. And can we talk about the ending and the fantastic Epilogue?? Both surprisingly sweet and sentimental, they added another level of emotional depth to an already great story. 
 REAPER'S FIRE is another fantastic, sexy and totally engrossing story from the talented Joanna Wylde.

 ""One is enough. It's unique. It's a chance, an opportunity, an experience. One is never greedy. One is independent. One can change everything."" 
 Jewel E. Ann has become my new favorite author!! I DEVOURED the Jack & Jill Series, and One features two characters from that series. Although this book can technically be read as a standalone, PLEASE PLEASE read the unforgettable books in the Jack & Jill Series first because there are some major spoilers. The author calls this genre Romantic Comedy but it so much more! Swoony romance, funny dialogue, dramatic moments and SEXY scenes...Cage and Lake are two very memorable characters. 
 Lake became an amputee after a tragic car accident that took the life of her fiancee. She has moved away from her family in California to Minneapolis, where she once again runs into the football star Cage, with whom she once shared an unforgettable kiss. She cat get Cage out of her head and cant believe he remembers her, too. Cage really sees Lake, not her disability, and she can't get him out of head. 
 ""Mind if I lose the leg?"" I asked. 
 He shook his head. There really were no words to describe how his lack of any sort of reaction made me feel. 
 Not one flinch. 
 Not one nervous glance at my leg. 
 Not one second of hesitation. 
 Cage is sexy, warm and loving. He falls fast for Lake, who is impulsive, funny, a little insecure and very, very honest. She makes a living by testing artificial limbs, and her work takes her all over the world. A trip to China provides one of the BEST scenes in the whole book!! It is so hard to categorize any of Jewel E. Ann's books, they really cover all the bases and I ended up highlighting half this book. 
 ""My mouth said thank you, but my heart said I love you."" 
 Lake is quickly thrust into the world of NFL pro football and things aren't always easy. Her family makes an appearance in this book and they are always there to support her. There are some very dramatic moments in this book which provided some very unexpected and very surprising twists, as only this author can do. The supporting characters are, as always, absolutely fantastic (Flint! Hello!! Would love to read your story!!) Warm, sexy and laugh-out-loud funny, ONE is another home run from this amazing author.

"Ahhhhh!! There's nothing like a Kylie Scott romantic comedy. Ever since 'Lick', I have been a huge fan of her witty and sexy writing. I am calling 'Twist' a friends-to-lovers story because Alex meets her ideal man online and they really do become ""friends"" even though it is through a dating site. She decides to surprise him and travels all the way to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. SURPRISE! It turns out she was not communicating with ""Eric"" but instead was really emailing with Joe, his brother. A big, sexy, lumbersexual brother. Not her type at all. Oh no. 
 ""With all the body-shaping underwear, lip gloss, heels, and tiny dress, you could almost say I'd been fibbing about who I was. His lie, however , left my Spanx and push-up bra way behind."" 
 Joe is beyond shocked to see Alex in person and her already-fragile ego takes a nose dive. One thing leads to another, and Alex decides to stay in town and realizes that Eric is actually not her type at all. It is Joe is the one who she really developed the relationship with. In all his bearded, muscled glory. Kylie Scott is a truly gifted writer and the banter banter between her characters is priceless. While we all know this story will have a happy ending, it is the journey there that is so satisfying. Alex is a real, relatable and very funny heroine, and the scenes between her and Joe are GOLD. 
 ""No more hiding or denying, sticking to the sidelines of life. It was my time to step forward and be brave. When it came to Joe Collins, I was more than ready to say yes."" 
 Alex is hilarious and warm and real and someone you would want as your best friend. The whole gang from the Dive Bar series is here plus my favorites from the Stage Dive series. BUT with that said, this is a complete standalone and you do not need to have read any of the earlier books. 
 'Twist' had plenty of steamy hot scenes and I think Joe Collins might be one of my favorite Kylie Scott characters. Joe and Alex have amazing chemistry and there is just enough angst to add the perfect amount of tension to this romance story. And all the kudos to Kylie Scott for writing a STRONG female heroine who goes after what she wants!! YES!! This is a funny, sexxxxxy, well-written and lighthearted romantic comedy. It has the perfect mix of dirty, laugh-out-loud humor and well-rounded characters. I'm booking a flight to Coeur d'Alene. 
 FAVORITE QUOTES: 
 ""When it came to Joe Collins, my pussy was a wanton whore. And seriously, who could blame it? His body was one big beautiful playground. There wasn't an inch of him I didn't want to explore."" 
 ""Basically,"" he said, voice little more than a rumble, ""with your permission, I just want to hold you down and make love to you for a good long time, watching your face as you come.""

"""I love you with everything I am, Ember."" 
 ""As do I, Nate. As do I."" 
 Once again, Harper Sloan delivers another SIZZLING hot Alpha and a GORGEOUS story with Nate and Ember! 
 This book in the Hope Town series is a spin-off from one of my FAVORITE series, the Corps Security series. There is nothing quite like reading a Harper Sloan book, with Alphas galore and lots of family and friendship. The children from the Corps Security families are grown now, and although each book in the Hope Town series can be read as a standalone, I cannot recommend the Corps Security books enough! 
 In When I'm With You, Nate and Ember can't stay away from each other after growing up together and having a falling out when she was a teenager. She has had a crush on him her whole life but he is quite a bit older than her. But now being the Alpha male that he is, he intends to show her every single day how much he loves her. There is male stripping involved in this book, some drama and tons of hawt and steamy sex. TONS! Plus a fabulous epilogue.

"""We plead biological necessity when caught straying. But that's often just a convenient rationalization to explain away a moment of moral failure-- of weakness. We can control ourselves."" 
 UNDONE is a weird, wild, thought-provoking and very witty story. It is part erotic thriller, part suspense and all satire. I finished this book a few weeks ago and had to think about the story for a while. This is a very risky book that is certainly not for everyone but is a fascinating commentary on society's obsession with celebrity and fame. UNDONE centers around Dez, a dangerous predator who is living with his former student, Chloe. Dez has a sick obsession with teenage girls, but totally rationalizes his unhealthy attraction and blames everyone else for his problems. He is smart but very, very troubled and borders on sociopathic. He ha convinced himself that his relationship with the teenage Chloe is almost normal. 
 ""But on a deeper level, shielded, hidden, he recognized some profound connection between them. He felt an almost frightening reliance on her, an emotional dependence. The feeling was unprecedented for him and brought him a form of happiness."" 
 Dez becomes obsessed with Jasper, a famous author who has written a best-selling book about his family. Dez creates a diabolical scheme to destroy Jasper, enlisting the gullible Chloe in his plan. So begins a suspenseful story that literally rockets along to a stunning conclusion, filled with biting commentary, completely inappropriate characters and very, very taboo subjects. 
 There is no question that John Colapinto is a brilliant writer and his prose and plot are flawless. BUT this book is NOT for the faint of heart or anyone who is offended by forbidden subjects! If you are looking for a standard romantic suspense novel, move along, because UNDONE is not for you. But if you love to read something different, incredibly creative and very challenging, then this is the book for you. Kudos to John Colapinto for tackling some very dangerous themes in an incredibly creative way. I found UNDONE to be enormously readable and I encourage anyone who loves something different to give this book a try. 
 On another note, I find it incredible that the author received over 40 rejection letters for this book! It is in no way the most taboo book I have ever read and I am glad that the publisher gave this book a chance.

"Years ago, if you'd told me I'd live in a house filled with women and pink shit everywhere, I would've laughed in your face. But it was my lot in life. Pink had replaced the white space, filling up every corner of my world. 
 LOVE this series and I absolutely adore City and Suzy! The first book in this series is still one of my favorites. Now City and Suzy's lives have changed quite dramatically with their young family and Suzy has some serious issues to deal with. This book is funny, sexy, heart-warming and action-packed, as are all the books in this series. And the Gallo men always step up to protect what's theirs. 
 I love every brother and love how they all are back in this wonderful entry in the Men of Inked series. 
 This book takes a little bit of a departure from the earlier books, but I loved the direction it took and Honor Me really stays true to the series. City is one of THE sexiest dads around and this book is a fast-paced, warm and witty addition to the Men of Inked series. Perfect for ail Chelle Bliss fans!

"I adored this sexy, heart-warming and very funny novella! Emma Chase continues to entertain readers with this delightful installment in the Legal Briefs series. Fans of this series will be enchanted by Jake's POV about life with his very full house. 
 No one writes a male POV like Emma Chase. In Sidebarred, we get more of Jake and Chelsea and even the other characters from the Legal Briefs series make appearances. This is a laugh-out-loud, feel-good short story about life in a crazy household with lots and lots of children. But since this is an Emma Chase story after all, there are lots of sexy times and sarcastic comments from the narrator. 
 ""We've been married for about two years and there hasn't been a single morning when I didn't wake with a smile tugging at my lips. Not one fucking time. Because she's beside me--half on top of my--and the six little shits we love more than anything are tucked safely away upstairs. They're all really good sleepers. That's key."" 
 There is always a happy ending with an Emma Chase story and you can bet she delivers lots of laughs along wth way. Once again she brings her unique comedic voice to a fantastic entry in the Legal Briefs series. Grab this highly entertaining story and enjoy a few hours of light, fun reading!

"Tessa Bailey is one of my favorite contemporary romance writers so I know that pretty much anything she writes, I am going to love. No one writes a steamy sex scene quite like Ms. Bailey. So I loved what she did with the story of Rita Clarkson, who has just accidentally burned down her mother's award-winning restaurant. On top of that, it was her mother's dying wish that Rita and her siblings - who aren't exactly close - travel to the East Coast to swim in the ocean on New Year's Day. 
 The Clarkson bunch is headed off on their road trip when their truck breaks down in the middle of New Mexico. The oh-so-hot Jasper enters enters the picture and offers them a ride into town and help with the local mechanic. So now the Clarkson family is stranded in the middle of nowhere. Yes, Jasper and Rita have instant chemistry BUT once again, Tessa Bailey surprises with Jasper: he's trying to make something of his life and live down his bad-boy reputation, and low expectations that everyone has of him. 
 What if-- to Rita--he could be Jasper, the decent soul and sparkling conversationalist? Standing right in front of Jasper was a woman without any preconceived-- or hell, conceived-- notions about him, and he couldn't recall the last time that had happened. 
 Rita and Jasper were amazing!! But Rita is worried about her future and can't stop thinking about life without Jasper. She thinks he is just a temporary diversion but Jasper is so much more than that! He is shocked that he actually wants to spend time with Rita and can't stop think about her. Tessa Bailey always creates such terrific characters and Rita and Jasper were no exception. I LOVED their scenes together - Jasper is TOTALLY Alpha - and adored the alternating POV's. You know you will always get an incredibly hot and sexy story with Ms. Bailey and add to that the wonderfully unique Clarkson family, then you have a great recipe for a funny, sexy and heartwarming story. 
 Here's the thing. I swore off women. But then you came pedaling into town with this mouth, those eyes and the way they see everything... and fuck yes, I want to kiss you. I want to do all manner of things to you."" 
 Too Hot to Handle is a very enjoyable start to the new series involving the Clarkson family!!

"""We were two cousins in love with the same girl."" 
 I really liked this book! I have never read anything by Katy Regency before and I love her style of writing. Set in the South, Ginger's Heart is a contemporary romance and a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. The story follows Ginger, Cain and Woodman, who have known each other their whole lives. Ginger has always loved bad-boy Cain, while his cousin, Woodman, has been in love with Ginger since she was a young girl. 
 Cain knows he can't have Ginger, he is loyal to his cousin and he stays away from Ginger. Both boys enlist in the military and the story follows the three of the through the years. I love a good love triangle and even if you are not a fan, the way Katy Regency is beautiful and passionate and emotional. It is easy to see why Ginger could not really choose between Cain and Woodman. 
 Cain is the one who play the ""wolf"" role in this story, he has a good heart but he has never lived up to his family's expectations for him. He is sexy, wild and irresistible. But he is fiercely loyal to his cousin and he treats Ginger like a princess. 
 ""He was uncouth, bad mannered, irreverent, impertinent, and irresponsible, with a mouth like a sailor before he'd become a sailor, and a dick that had seen so much indiscriminate action, it's a wonder it still worked."" 
 Everyone exited Ginger to spend the rest of her life with Woodman. He is devoted to Ginger and she loves him but not the same way that she loves Cain. I really liked Woodman and was rooting for Ginger to love him! This book takes a very surprising turn near the end which I did not see coming. I absolutely loved the span of years in this book and loved watching Ginger grow up. Katy Regency makes both Cain and Woodman very sympathetic characters and the story is romantic, sexy and very emotional in some parts. 
 ""It doesn't make one of us a villain and one of us a hero. You can't help who you love. But someone's heart was goin' to break."" 
 This is a very engaging and lovely story with a very creative twist. I loved it and can't wait to read more books from Katy Regnery.

"I FINISHED!!! This book took me FOREVER to read! But I am so glad I stuck with it, I really loved it. It took me a while to get into: this book has a TON of characters and storylines. But once I hit about the 100-page mark, I became very invested in the story and couldn't wait to see what would happen with Lizzie, Lane, Edward, Gin and the rest of the family. Oh, and Samuel T. There's a little bit of sex but mostly this is a sweeping romance novel, much like Dynasty and Dallas from the 1980's. If you loved those series, you will love this book. There's betrayal, unrequited love, family fortunes, and much scheming. 
 There are many characters to love here and many to hate. Some are over-the-top but I loved the central storyline involving Lane and Lizzie. 
 The author really gets the Southern mannerisms right, and the backdrop of the Kentucky Bourbon industry is fascinating. This book ends not so much on a cliffhanger but with many, many loose ends, and I will eagerly pick up the next book in this series.",10,4,1,187,46.7,6.19,61.9,84.18,14.38,14.97,88.24,70.05,57.22,12.3,6.42,5.35,0.0,1.07,0.0,0.0,5.88,17.11,8.56,1.6,10.7,6.42,6.95,10.16,1.07,12.83,6.95,9.09,1.07,0.53,0.53,0.0,9.63,0.53,9.09,0.0,0.0,1.07,2.67,1.07,4.28,0.0,7.49,5.88,1.6,4.28,3.74,0.53,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,5.35,4.28,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.53,0.53,1.07,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.53,0.0,0.0,5.35,0.53,0.53,3.74,1.07,0.0,1.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.07,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.07,0.0,0.53,5.88,8.56,0.53,1.07,5.88,0.53,0.0,0.53,4.28,3.74,4.81,1.07,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,19.79,5.88,7.49,0.0,2.14,2.14,2.14,0
"4/5 STARS!! 
 To say that I will read anything that Natasha Boyd writes is an understatement. Her EverseaSeries is one of my most treasured series ever (HELLO! Have you seen those stunning covers?) and the story of Keri Ann and Jack Eversea, the classic Hollywood-superstar-meets-smalltown-girl, is a MUST-READ. With that being said, you do NOT need that have read the Eversea series before diving into Jazz and Joey's story! 
 Jazz is on the brink of adulthood. waiting to start her life after graduating from high school in Butler Cove. Natasha's gorgeous sense of place permeates the story here just like in the Eversea books, with the Lowcountry of South Carolina playing a prominent part of the story. Joey is her best friend's older brother, the gorgeous, cocky, unattainable crush that Jazz has had her whole life. 
 While Jazz was the funny, comic relief in the other books, here we see a much more sensitive side to her. All of the characters here are richly drawn, just like I would expect from Natasha Boyd. And can we talk about the kisses? Hands-down THE sweetest, hottest, SEXIEST kissing scenes EVER. They perfectly capture the heat and passion of young love, the longing, and the heart-pounding romance. Bravo, Ms. Boyd! 
 ""You set a standard by which all future kisses will be measured."" 
 All That Jazz is about summer romance, unrequited love and all of the angst that goes along with growing up. Joey and Jazz have amazing banter together and when he asks for a HUGE favor from her (to be his ""pretend"" girlfriend), we can definitely see what direction that will go in. The constant back-and-forth between Jazz and Joey was priceless. Jazz didn't always make the right choices but she is struggling to find her place in the world and I absolutely adored the conclusion that the author gave to these amazing characters. Nothing was rushed, nothing felt forced, it all felt perfect and true to these characters. 
 This book is like a breath of fresh air and Natasha Boyd remains one of my favorite writers today. And now I must immediately purchase this gorgeous paperback to add to my beautiful collection of Butler Cover books!

"This baseball romance is HOT HOT HOT!! 
 This is my first book by Eve Jagger and she does not disappoint with this steamy story served up with a side of Southern charm. It is very obvious that the author really knows her subject matter and setting! And Knox and Shelby make for a super-enjoyable, very hot, fast-paced read. 
 Knox is a major-league baseball player who has been suddenly traded to the Atlanta Braves. Although he's shocked, trades are a part of the sport and he is excited to be back with his old friends and also to maybe find the woman he spent one hot New Year's Eve with. Shelby is a smart, gorgeous woman who is now working in PR for the Atlanta Falcons football team. Shelby and Knox run into each other again, and Knox is in for a big surprise when he finds out that Shelby is the younger sister of his friend Jackson. 
 Shelby's brother is, to put it mildly, overprotective of his sister and who she dates. So Knox and Shelby have to hide their mega-steamy romance from her brother. Sneaking around is not what Shelby had in mind. It is clear these two have some major obstacles to overcome. Will Knox stand up to Jackson? Will Shelby be able to convince her brother that she is an adult and can make her own choices? 
 The banter between Knox and Shelby is priceless. She looks down on the sport of baseball (at first!) and the one-liners about sports are hilarious. Although this is a sports romance, you do NOT have to be a sports fan to appreciate the dirty-talking Knox or the behind-the-scenes look into the sport of baseball. 
 The prequel novella, ONE NIGHT WITH KNOX, is equally hot and although I read it after KNOX, sets up the steamy one night stand when Knox and Shelby first meet. Overall, this series is sweet, sexy, fast-paced and very enjoyable. I love Ms. Jagger's writing style and will definitely read more in the Sexy Bastards series!

"Well, then! A complete and total mindf*k!! The beginning of the book was a little disorientating but once I got past the first few chapters, I was rewarded with a very clever and twisty romantic suspense story. Very memorable characters and an interesting storyline. Not at all what I expected. 
 The book begins right in the middle of a very tense scene which I had to go back and re-read after finishing this book. At first I was very disoriented by the story and could not figure out where the author was going or what these characters were going to do. I was completely and totally taken aback by the direction this story took and raced though this book in one sitting! 
 This is one of those books that should be read without knowing too much about the plot. I did not know anything about this author or the story before reading and I was pleasantly surprised. PAPER DOLLS is suspenseful, thrilling, very surprising and has a very enthralling storyline. Kudos to Hanna Peach for creating an unforgettable cast of characters and bringing very important topics to light and treating the subject matter with great sensitivity and understanding. 
 Hanna Peach is an author to watch and I look forward to reading more books from this talented writer!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 I absolutely LOVE Lilah Pace and will read ANYTHING she writes! So I was thrilled to be able to read her M/M romance, His Royal Secret. James and Ben's story drew me in from the first page and I was completely blown away by their story. 
 James is the future King of England. He is devoted to the Royal protocol and has always lived his life in the public eye. He only knows a life of personal butlers, security teams and duty to the Throne. There's only one little issue: he is a deeply closeted gay man.. He has only had a handful of relationships in his life and they usually ended badly. He lives a very lonely and isolated life, despite his public ""fiancee"", Lady Cassandra, who is actually is best friend and has always kept his secret. 
 Ben is a smart, sexy journalist who is very comfortable with his sexuality. He is gorgeous and James finds himself hoping against hope that Ben could love someone like him - after all, James keeps his private life a secret, is a member of the Royal family, and will always have to adhere to strict protocols. His whole life has been mapped out for him. 
 These two did meet under a pretense but once they got that out of the way, James realized that he really liked Ben, besides being insanely attracted to him. Ben is a worldwide traveler and adventurer and has always been too busy with his career to ever stay with one man for too long - especially after a disastrous first relationship. But he sees that James is a wonderful, sensitive and caring man and perfect for Ben. 
 ""I didn't lie to you to get a story. At least, not after the first few minutes."" 
 ""Then why?"" 
 After a moment's pause, Ben said, very slowly, ""Because I hoped I could get you into bed."" 
 I absolutely loved the detailed descriptions of Royal life! You could see how it could stifle someone from the outside, who had never grown up within the British monarchy. James is frightened that it will all scare Ben away. Plus, they are seeing other in secret. James is also deathly afraid that once the media grabs the story, that they will completely destroy Ben. 
 James has a very tragic family history and a sister who has deep-seated emotional issues. James is totally devoted to her and will do anything to protect her from public scrutiny. But if he is ""exposed,"" then he fears Indigo's stability may be threatened. 
 I fell in love with with James and Ben! As always, Lilah Pace's writing is superb. There is no uneccesary drama here, just a beautiful story of two souls falling in love but unsure of whether they can ever have a future together. The book ends rather suddenly BUT James and Ben's story continues in His Royal Favorite, which is out now! 
 ""You belong to me. Maybe the public and the press own the part of you that's THE PRINCE, but not THE MAN. You're mine, and I won't let anything take you away.""

"4.5 - 5 Stars! 
 What would you do if your whole life was planned out for you from birth? That is what James is faced with in this conclusion to His Royal Secret. James has decided to come out publicly and face the British public and the Church of England. If he has to give up the throne for Ben, he is ready to do so. 
 His Royal Favorite is an absolutely riveting story, filled with emotion, passion and sexy, tender moments. The detail is perfect, and I loved being immersed in the world of a British royal family. James and Ben must face not only his family, but the public and the threat of Ben losing his career when James decides to come out. But seeing how Ben has lived his life honestly makes him realize that he must stop living a lie. He alway cannot bear the thought that Lady Cassandra, his best friend, would have given up her life for him in a sham marriage. 
 There are actually lots of funny moments in this book and I adored the author's sense of humor! The gay club, Ben's interactions with the Queen and the headlines when Ben is named as James's boyfriend are all priceless. But both James and Ben realize that their whole lives will change soon and especially Ben, who will never, ever regain his privacy again. 
 ""Freedom would be you coming here all alone, cruising the room, picking up any one of the countless guys in here who're already hard just thinking about you. . ."" 
 ""No. Not without you. Being without you wasn't freedom. Loving you is what sets me free."" 
 The dual POV's work perfectly in this book. The sexy factor is off the charts but it is the beautiful, emotional connection between James and Ben that makes this such a great story. I held my breath near the end of the book out of fear for where this story was going, but the magnificent Epilogue absolutely took my breath away. 
 His Royal Favorite is a mature, passionate and sexy story about love and family and and sacrifice and living your best life. Every character felt real, and there were no real villains in this story. This book is a richly detailed and extremely satisfying romance. The peek inside a fictional British royal family was completely fascinating. All in all, I LOVED this series and can't wait for what Lilah Pace writes next!

"""She's the love of my life. And I'm not walking away from her, even for a second."" 
 A Thousand Boy Kisses is a lovely, poignant and sweet coming-of-age story with just the right amount of heat. Poppy and Rune are sure to become two of Tillie Cole's most beloved characters. I fell in love with both of them! 
 Kiss eight hundred and nineteen was the kiss that changed it all. The kiss that proved that a long-haired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats. 
 Hopefully you haven't read any spoilers for this book because I will say that the ending COMPLETELY surprised me! These two completely and totally loved each other from the time they were children. They were inseparable. Then Rune suddenly has to move away with his family, but the worst heartbreak was that Poppy cut him off with no explanation. His heart was broken. But that's not even the sad part of the book. Rune returns several years later but he is different, changed, all because of what he suffered through. 
 Poppy is devastated to realize that her treatment of Rune is what caused him to become moody and cold towards her. When she finally tells him the truth about why she cut him off, he becomes totally devoted to her. Please listen to the author's own description of this book as a ""tearjerker""! Because that's what it is. I loved Rune's absolute devotion to Poppy and her strength and bravery was beautiful. 
 This is an extremely emotional book but yet the story and the characters are incredibly engaging. I loved everything about this book, from the gorgeous cover to the story behind the thousand kisses. Grab a box of tissues and be prepared to fall in love with Poppy and Rune.

"4.5 Gold-Medal Stars!! 
 SCORE!!!!! I knew when I read the synopsis for this book that I absolutely had to read it!! After falling in love with Liam and Kinsley in SCORING WILDER, I could not WAIT for R.S. Grey to release this sexy, funny-as-hell story about the Summer Olympic Games in Rio. Throw in a sexy British swimming superstar and a funny, beautiful, and driven soccer player, and I'm all in. 
 The Summer Games is definitely NOT just for fans of sports romance. This story is addictive, fun, enjoyable and very, very funny. R.S. Grey's one-liners are absolutely hilarious. Andie is a champion women's soccer player, in Rio for the Olympic games. She's young, fit, focused on the competition but ready to let loose in the Olympic Village. 
 ""I had to keep up my workouts and diet. Sure, I'd nearly chugged a bottle of vodka the day before, but sometimes vodka counts as medicine."" 
 Of course she was warned to stay away from bad-boy British swim champion Freddie Archibald, but Andie is just what Freddie needed in his life. He is promised to another woman, an uptight social climber to whom appearances are everything. Caroline is the opposite of Andie and Freddie has no intention of continuing with their sham ""engagement."" 
 R.S. Grey really brings in on in the romance department in this book. This is is MUCH sexier than some of her other books and I absolutely ADORED it!!! Andie and Freddie are incredible together. But will their romance continue after they have both left the Summer Games behind? 
 ""I needed her more than I needed my next race. The water was soothing, but Andie lit me on fire."" 
 I loved how strong and competitive Andie was and how she stayed laser-focused on her team and the games. And I always love a dual POV - and R.S. Grey executes the male POV perfectly here. Oh and Freddie's sister Georgie was funny and charismatic and I would love a book about her!! Just saying. I highly recommend The Summer Games, it is completely addictive! I can't wait for the next book in this series!!

 Swear on This Life is one of THE best second-chance romances I've ever read. This book is perfection!!! 
 I really can't do justice to this beautiful and heart-wrenching story. This is one of those books that absolutely must be experienced by reading the author's own perfectly-crafted words. Swear on This Life is incredibly imaginative, creative and heart-stopping, and is one of my favorite books this year. 
 I finished this book months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. It is a book I have been telling all my non-bookish co-workers and friends to read. I completely tuned out the world when I read this book and wanted to spend every waking minute reading it. The past and present blend together seamlessly in this book and there are flashbacks within flashbacks. This could be confusing BUT Renee Carlino does it brilliantly here. There are really 4 main characters in this book: ""real-life"" Emiline and Jace, and ""fictional"" Emerson and Jackson. The early days of the real main characters and the fictional characters are absolutely harrowing. Emiline has now escaped her past and grown up to make a perfectly nice life for herself. She struggles, however, to find her voice as a writer. She has tried her best to put her painful past behind her, but reading the popular best-selling book featuring Emerson and Jackson has brought her childhood crashing into her present-day self in a way she is not quite ready to face. 
 ""Most of the time people who are lost don't ever find their way back."" 
 I like to be challenged as a reader and Swear on This Life did just that. It is a fascinating and unique second-chance romance like none other. At times excruciatingly painful and brutally honest, the book is also romance and women's fiction at it's very best. There is actually some humor to lighten up the overall heavy tone of the book along with an intensely sweet first love story. Emotional and satisfying, Swear on This Life is a must-read. 
 ""Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect, but until you know the whole story, it's impossible to see the universe at work, or even admit that there is something bigger than us, making sure everything that should happen does happen.""

"4.5 STARS!!! 
 More readers NEED to know about Olivia Evans! Good lord, this woman can WRITE. The Prologue alone was fantastic If you love a slow-burn romance, with well-written characters that have depth, real emotion and absolutely no cliches, then you must read Brooklyn & Beale. 
 This is one of the best rock star books I have read. Olivia Evans paints a detailed picture of the life of a touring musician, with all of the temptations, pressures and pure joy of performing live on stage. I could almost feel the tension that Chloe and Reid felt before they stepped on stage each night. 
 This is a slow-burn story. Reid and Chloe build a beautiful and deep friendship and kinship. They are both brilliant musicians, she a violist and he the lead signer of a famous band. They go on a year-long tour world together and get to one another slowly, as friends do, 
 Reid is a recovering addict but he is not a one-dimensional character, my heart ached for him and the choices he made. Chloe is funny, smart, feisty and protective of her friend Reid. But their on-screen chemistry spills over into real life, as carefully as they wanted to stop that from happening, 
 Reid sucked in a sharp breath and leaned forward. In the cover of the darkened stage, his cheek brushed against Chloe's as he moved his lips to her ear. ""Please don't hate me,"" he whispered. He straightened his back, and with a gentle touch, wiped the wetness from her cheek. 
 Chloe squared her shoulders. ""I don't,"" was all she said before turning toward the crowd and readying her violin for the next song. 
 This is a beautiful, sometimes painful, always REAL, honest and very sweet and sexy story. I applaud Ms. Evan for a creating an engaging and inventive storyline that drew me in and made me FEEL the characters' emotions. Give this Indie author a try, you will be pleasantly surprised! 
 ""I can't lose you, Chloe."" 
 ""Lose me in what way, Reid? I'm your bandmate. But beyond that, what is there?"" 
 She was so much more than his bandmate, but he could never tell her that. ""You're my best friend.""

"Original, fresh, fast-paced, sexy.... LOVED every word of this book!! 
 L.J. Shen has written an incredibly thrilling and amazingly satsifying book. I love her writing style and can't wait to read her other books. This story grabbed me by the throat from the first word and didn't let go until the very last page. And what a beginning! Sparrow has found herself in a sudden arranged marriage to one of Boston's most notorious criminals, Troy Brennan. 
 He has a troubled past. A disastrous future. And I'm about to become a part of his present, whether I like it or not. 
 Sexy, dangerous, with not one ounce of kindess or compassion, Troy is a feared and legendary figure in Boston's crime circles. Sparrow has known of him all of her life, having grown up on the mean streets of Boston and with a father who was a low-level member of one of Troy's father gangs. Sparrow has no clue why she has been forced into this marriage because Troy seems to hate her as much as she hates him, and they both seem revolted by the idea of being married to each other. 
 ""Dear future wife..."" He smirked in a way that made me want to beg for mercy. ""If you think you're going to give me trouble, think again. I invented trouble. I stir it, I mix it, I fucking fix it. Don't try my patience, because you'll discover I have absolutely none. 
 Sparrow is feisty, resilient, smart and yes, very innocent and sheltered in many ways. She has no qualms about standing up to Troy, and he actually likes it. Sparrow is different from all the gold-digging women who are only interested in his wealth and his power. He actually kind of likes her, in his own, sick, very twisted way. But Sparrow learns quickly how to survive in her gilded cage and is thrilled when Troy agrees to let her work in one of his restaurants. 
 The sexual chemistry in this book is explosive!! Troy is the ulimtate bad boy. But what makes this book so unique is the witty sarcasm from both her main characters and the crsip and snappy dialogue. I read this book in almost one sitting and I still want more!! 
 ""I was in love with a murderer who didn't love me back, who never explained why he took me for his wife. It wasn't fine, wasn't okay, but it was the ugly, embarrassing, uncomfortable truth. Considering how fucked up my truth was, I began to understand why Troy gave me something far more convenient and beautiful. He gave me lies, and I ate them from the palm of his hand. He gave me lies, and for him, I closed my eyes. 
 This book rockets forward at a breakneck speed, with an incredible storyline that kept me guessing until the very end. There are many memorable supporting characters but Troy and Sparrow are the main focus and i kept hoping that Troy wasn't really as evil as he seemed to be. Sparrow is no pushover and I absolutely adored the ending that author gave these two. This book is one of my favorite books so far this year and it is defintely the most original. I highly recommend this story and can't wait to read more from this author!

"This book was THE definition of slow-burn romance and it was fantastic! A long read but well worth it. Mariana Zapata creates incredibly REAL characters with real fears, disapppintments and dreams. Everything you've heard about this author is true. She takes her sweet time to build a connection between her MC's so that when they get to their HEA, it feels RIGHT. 
 ""I would have done just about anything for you back then, even when you got on my nerves. I might have just waited until the last minute to push you out of oncoming traffic, but I'd still push you out of the way."" 
 That's what I'm talking about! This book is on many readers' top favorite books for good reason. Colorful characters, well-written dialogue and sweet, sweet romance. Highly recommend!!

"4.5 STARS!!! 
 ""Falling in love might not have been on my list...but I'm glad I fell in love with you, Liam."" 
 I read this witty, funny, SEXXXXY, beautiful story in one sitting. Do NOT let the title scare you away! The Ending I Want is a very positive story in many ways, even though the plot is pretty much revealed early on in the book. Samantha Towle is such a capable writer that this story could have turned into a tired cliche. Instead, it is an exciting, fast-paced, immensely enjoyable book with two very memorable main characters. 
 Can we talk about Liam? At first I thought, ""Oh no, not another wealthy British businessman!"" But he is warm, smart, sensitive and ALPHA all rolled up into one perfect package. The problem is that Taylor Shaw only has plans to visit England for two very short weeks. Which means that she might have to tell Liam about the secret that she is trying not-so-successly to hide from him. 
 ""I would have stayed because I'm pretty sure I was in love with you from the moment you surprise-kissed me on the plane. You had me instantly."" 
 The Ending I Want is not overly-sentimental or sappy. Instead it is the perfect mix of humor, hope and love. I absolutely loved this unexpectedly beautiful story. Oh, and The Mighty Storm fans - watch for an appearance by Jake Wethers!! 
 Favorite Quote:

"""Revenge is my only thought. Killing is my ultimate goal. Death is the only justice."" 
 Kim Jones delivers a gritty, sexy, fast-paced follow-up to Sinner's Creed, one of my favorite biker romances. This book packs a LOT of surprises and features a totally kick-ass heroine in Diem. The back-and-forth banter between Shady and Diem feels very real and is almost heartbreaking at times due to Shady's thirst for revenge and his dangerous, nomadic lifestyle. Kim Jones weaves an extremely satisfying story with Sinner's Revenge. Highly recommend this one for all lovers of biker romance!!

"Just, WOW. My first Kim Jones book and it absolutely BLEW ME AWAY! Sinners Creed excited me, stunned me, shocked me and yes, even made me cry. Which is not an easy feat. Even if you've read a lot of MC books, this book will surprise you and thrill you and I can't recommend it highly enough. 
 This is an unwavering, no-holds-barred look into club life, with all of the violence, sex and raw emotion you can imagine. Brotherhood comes before all else, and these men will sacrifice everything for their brothers. Dirk is no exception: he has become a notorious enforcer, a nomad, who travels wherever Club business takes him, always alone, always doing what needs to be done, no matter what the price. 
 Saylor comes into his life quite by accident, and gradually, slowly, they develop a deep and loving bond. Dirk has lived a sad, brutal life, and Saylor finally is something good in his life. Saylor is running from something, and Dirk agrees to take her on his travels across the country. 
 It is best if you go into this book without knowing too much detail about the plot. I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it. It turns out that Saylor loves to ride, and really, she is the only joyful part of Dirk's violent existence. This book took a very surprising turn which was perfect for these two characters. Some will love it, some will not, but take a chance on Sinner's Creed and go on the Dirk and Saylor's journey with them. This book was magical, gritty, raw and beautiful all at once.

"4.5 - 5 MISSION-ACCOMPLISHED STARS!! 
 WOW!!! As a jaded romance reader, I am rarely taken by surprise by books that I read. Well, FLY WITH ME took me by surprise from the first page! This sexxxxy and emotional story grabbed my heart and didn't let go. Handsome fighter pilot? Check. Smart, curvy, sweet heroine? Check. Two older characters who have dated a lot and know what they want and go after it? CHECK!!! 
 This is the first book in the new Wild Aces series and follows a group of fighter pilots. I fell in love with Noah and his passion for flying and his devotion to his country. These men put their duties first and it isn't easy to have a family with their schedules. Noah has never been tied down before until he meets Jordan in Las Vegas art her sister's bachelorette party. She is just looking for a night of fun from her quiet life as a store owner back in Florida. 
 How often could you say that you could pinpoint the exact moment when your life changed? 
 What makes this book different is the vivid portrayal of both Noah and Jordan's points of view. Noah is mouth-wateringly gorgeous, Alpha, smart and he wants Jordan. Jordan is smart, funny, and open, and Noah finds himself instantly attracted. 
 But what happens after a torrid night in Vegas? Will Noah go back to his base in Oklahoma and Jordan home to Florida? I absolutely loved how these two struggled to figure out how to make their blossoming relationship work. There is something about an older hero and heroine that really gets to me. I appreciate their honesty and their passion. I read this book in one sitting and wanted more. I laughed, I cried, I was turned on...this book has it all. I am so glad I took a chance on a new-to-me-author. FLY WITH ME is a winner and I can't recommend this book highly enough!!

"3.5 -4 ADDICTIVE STARS 
 This place is like the Garden of Eden. Beautiful but full of danger. 
 There was SO much to love about this book! Ella, the feisty, smart and sarcastic survivor. The sex, lust, and dirty talk. The fast-moving storyline. I really liked this book a lot but the over-the-top teen drama, the cruelty and the unecessary theatrics got in the way from making this a homerun for me. 
 Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick (the pair behind Erin Watt) are amazingly talented and gifted writers. Their writing talent made this book a TOTAL guilty pleasure, with a very likeable and resilient heroine and TONS of hot and heavy lust and sex. Ella Harper finds herself suddenly living in a world of almost unimaginable wealth and privilege after Callum Royal, her father's old friend, becomes her legal guardian. She is a poor girl who did what she had to support herself and get through high school. Suddenly, she is enrolled in private school and living in a house filled with Callum's sons, who are resentful of her, to say the least. They are on a mission to destroy her, and to make her leave. Despite their taunts and their endless bullying, she refuses to leave and is only after one thing: to finish high school and go to college. 
 ""You should get away from here. These Royals will ruin you."" 
 Oh but there's the little detail of Reed Royal. The meanest of them all (and that's saying a lot), he and Ella hate each other at first sight but then can't stay away from each other. Even though I disliked Reed at the beginning, he began to grow on me and I could see how Ella eventually found him irresistible: 
 ""He has everything a girl could want: the hard body, the handsome face that will still look good years from now, the money, and that extra something. Charisma, I guess. The ability to slay you with a single look. The apple is dangling in front of me, juicy red and delicious, but, like the fairy tale, Reed Royal is the villain disguised as a pretty prince. Taking a bite out of him would be a huge mistake. 
 The Royals run the school and everyone there follows their orders. This book reminded me a lot of Beverly Hills 90210 and Gossip Girl. There is no question that this story is unputdownable. I just would have liked less cruelty and a little more reality. Nonetheless, I will most DEFINITELY read the next book because this one ends on quite the cliffhanger! I really do want to see what is next for Ella Harper. 
 ""Auden wrote that when the boy falls from the sky after calamity after calamity, he still has a future somewhere and that there's no point in dwelling on one's loss. But did he suffer this? Would he have written that if he had lived my life?

"5 fighting stars!! 
 ""I'll fight for us, but I'll need you to fight too."" 
 JB Salsbury has written a classic friends-to-lovers story, with two characters that I loved from her previous books. Killian and Axelle have been best friends since childhood, but Kill is not your typical bad-boy MMA fighter. He's a nerd in high school, and worships Axelle from afar. He thinks she could never be interested in someone like him, a geek who wears glasses, quiet and nerdy. Axelle, who has bad terrible choices in men, secretly loves him, but she doesn't feel worthy enough for the smart, driven Killian. 
 There is more emotion, sexual tension and heartbreak packed into this book then many books twice the size. I could not put this book down and this story touched me on so many levels that I am still thinking about it a week after finishing! I fell in love with Killian. He is now my favorite of all the Fighting boys. Sweet, sexy, protective, strong, gentle - he is the TOTAL package. 
 And Axelle is a fantastic heroine, she makes bad choices, is far from perfect but picks herself up and moves on and makes a better life for herself. She realizes early on that she can't hold Killian back from a stellar fighting career and refuses to hold him back. 
 ""I can't lose him to someone else. But I can't allow him to pass up on a chance at happiness with someone else either."" 
 Axelle and Killian's story is emotional, thrilling, sexy, filled with heartbreak, hope and promise. 
 This book was perfect in every way. The boy and girl secretly in love with each other, the years spent apart, the incredible sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine, and the beautiful and strong families who support them both unconditionally. I adored how the author allowed Axelle to overcome her insecurities and become her own woman. I love everything JB Salsbury writes but FIGHTING FATE is one of her very best books!I didn't think it possible, but I have become an even bigger fan after reading FIGHTING FATE. The dual POV was perfection and I can't wait for more books from Ms. Salsbury.

"""One year is all it took to change my life completely. One moment to shift it on a different course. One second of a stranger's kiss--a rock on a window--a call from out of the blue. All of it started with one girl and a question."" 
 OMG!!! I loved this book!!! It is heart-stoppingly beautiful but has moments of humor as well. I hope everyone will read this AMAZING story. It is incredibly poignant, readable and will hit home with many readers. For others, I hope it will offer insight into a painful and often debilitating condition. 
 At the center of this story is a summer road trip taken by college roommates Cline and Elliot, along with Cline's former childhood best friend, Audrey Byrd. Cline and Audrey had some kind of falling out, the reasons for which are slowly revealed over the course of the story. Cline, Elliot and Audrey hit the road to try and help Audrey find out about her past. Audrey is clearly troubled, living with a cold father and a cruel stepmother. But as pieces of her life are eventually uncovered during the trio's travels, not all is at it seems. Amber Johnson skillfully paints each character in this book carefully and realistically and with lots of humor and wit. The dialogue crackles and pops and provides comic relief to the heavy subject matter. 
 Elliot was immediately attracted to Audrey and their romance is a slow-burn, born from friendship and understanding and a shared sense of humor. I LOVED these two together and can't stop thinking about them! 
 ""We're going to be the greatest love story never told."" 
 Even if you are not a fan of YA novels, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The deep empathy that Amber Johnson has for her characters shines through on every page of this book. What starts out as a mystery as to why Cline and Audrey's friendship ended, evolves into a sensitive and deeply sympathetic story about anxiety and depression, and finally, romance. 
 Audrey battles with being honest with Cline and finally tells him the truth. A series of very dramatic events then unfolds but the author delivers a wonderful and very fitting conclusion for the main characters. I can't say enough about this story, I loved Audrey and Elliot and the way Elliot treated her. The writing is gorgeous and lyrical and very, very brave. Clever, heartfelt, and with just the perfect amount of heat, She Dims the Stars is my favorite book so far by Amber Johnson.

"Well that was very unexpected and different! I am a huge fan of L.H. Cosway and this is my first book by Penny Reid. This is part of the Rugby series but can absolutely be read as a standalone. This book is NOT your typical sports romance! It features a gorgeous ruby star who surprisingly, needs to learn some skills in the bedroom! This is a very funny and VERY sexy take on a familiar theme and I enjoyed every word of this story. 
 Lucy is the sister of a star rugby player. She is quirky, different and has a very unusual way of dealing with anxiety - she has a compulsion to shoplift. Not so easy to hide when the media is lurking everywhere. At first she dislikes Sean, her brother's teammate, but beneath his bad-boy reputation is a kind, generous and loving soul. 
 ""Beauty comes in many forms, and the strong, powerful kind is the most admirable. It's easy to be weak; you simply do nothing, but strength takes courage and effort."" 
 Sean has his own issues to deal with. He doesn't seem interested in proving his teammates wrong about his cocky reputation and his family is not exactly warm and fuzzy. Lucy is afraid of alienating her brother if he finds out that she and Sean are seeing each other, so they agree to keep their romance a secret at first. Lucy is going to teach Sean how to be a better lover - I LOVED how they did NOT start off with spectacular sex!! But Sean is so sweet and is a very, very good student. He begins to develop real feelings for Lucy and she begins to fall for Sean, too. 
 ""I don't want to close my eyes when I could be looking at you"" 
 The Player and the Pixie is a sweet, funny and totally fresh story. I absolutely adored Lucy and Sean and the very unique storyline. These two are very memorable characters and I highly recommend this book even if you are not usually a fan of sports romance!

"4.5 DIRTY STARS!! 
 Refreshingly funny and SOOO sexy!! Kyle Scott is laugh-out-loud funny. 
 DIRTY is a fantastic start to a new series from Kylie Scott. The book starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Lydia has run away from her own wedding, climbing over a fence and right into an empty house. Except that the owner is there and is very surprised to find a runaway bride in his own bathroom, distraught and still in her wedding gown. 
 ""Even with no clothing to take cues from, the dude was clearly the epitome of cool. He looked about my age, or maybe a little older. He had longish red-blond hair, dark blue eyes set in an angular face, a lean but muscular torso covered in tattoos, and a rather large cock. Not that I meant to check him out, it's just kind of hard to ignore a penis and scrotum when they're dangling right in front of your face. I tilted my head, trying to get some perspective. Every viewpoint, however, was equally shocking. There was dick as far as the eye could see. 
 And I should stop ogling him. Right."" 
 This was supposed to be Lydia's wedding day and she is, to put it mildly, distraught. But she still maintains her sense of humor even in the face of a cheating ex-fiancee and his overbearing family. Vaughan is a nice guy and offers to let Lydia stay with him until she is able to get back on her feet. Even though he probably shouldn't trust a woman who has broken into his house, he likes her and her curves and her smart mouth. 
 ""You touch any of my stuff?"" he asked. ""Take anything?"" 
 ""Yes, your sofa is cunningly hidden down the front of my dress. You won't believe where I fit the TV."" 
 Again, his eyes narrowed dangerously. ""Between you and me, probably not the time to be funny, babe."" 
 Lydia finds herself working at the local Dive Bar with Vaughan and his family and friends. Lydia grows to love the Idaho town she has found herself in and can see herself making a life there and putting down roots. Vaughan, however, is a different story. He is chasing dreams of being a musician and isn't ready to give that up. He and Lydia really like each other but neither one is ready for anything serious, so, they agree to a friends-with-benefits arrangement. . . which, of course, means at least one of them is going to fall in love. Hey, this IS a romance, after all!! And who can resist Vaughan? 
 ""Clearly, there were far more northern Idaho sex gods than I'd given the region credit for. Further classifications were going to be required. If Vaughan topped the super-cool category, then maybe this new guy should win on the lumbersexual front. Given my abrupt return to singledom, I'd have to give this important man-classification system more thought. 
 Disclaimer: Objectifying people is wrong and stuff."" 
 DIRTY is a fun and funny, sexy, warm-hearted romance that hits all the right notes. There is no unnecessary drama and lots of fantastic, interesting supporting characters. I adored everything about this book. Ms. Scott is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I can't wait to read the next book in this series!! 
 ""When his lips opened a little, just enough to softly kiss my bottom lip, I swear I swooned. Over and over he kissed my lips, first the top then the bottom, the sides and the corner from where my smile started. No part was left untouched. My smile grew wider, my nipples hard and my loins Vaughan-addled. That's a medical term.""

"4.5 'Just Jump' Stars! 
 Enter the giveaway for a SIGNED paperback HERE 
 K. Bromberg continues to surprise with this strikingly mature and deeply-felt romance! Although Zander is the son of Colton Donavan from the Driven series, this book can absolutely stand on its own. Down Shift is an incredibly sexy and emotional story. Zander and Getty's book reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance. A definite must-read! 
 Zander was always one of my favorite characters from the 'Driven' series. He was adopted by Colton and Rylee as a child but now he is a grown man tormented by personal demons. He is tortured and making poor decisions and living a crazy life. Well, that doesn't fly when you're the son of the renowned Colton Donavan and Zander is promptly fired by his own father from the racing team. Colton tells Zander to cool off and come back when he can be a responsible member of the famed racing team. 
 Hateful words are exchanged between father and son and Zander takes off. The Donavan clan are one tight-knit bunch, but no one knows where Zander is. It was heartbreaking to read about the pain that his family must have been going through while Zander sorted himself out. 
 Getty is also trying to make a fresh start and get back on her feet. She is running from something or someone and trusts absolutely no one. She is living a very simple life in a cottage while working in a local bar. Getty and Zander quite literally run into each other in the middle of the night in the MOST unexpected way! 
 'I force myself to look away because . . . well, because he's a stranger. In my house. Naked. And oh my God, something is wrong with me, because I'm not running and calling 911 like I should.' 
 Getty and Zander's romance is a slow-build, based on trust and friendship and heat. The author takes time to create her characters and their relationship and so the reader really gets to 'know' these two characters. They are both in pain, but can they save each other from their pasts? 
 The Prologue was filled with emotion for me, I literally cried while reading the heated between Colton and his beloved son Zander. This intense emotional connection with the main characters continued throughout the story. 'Down Shift' is THE perfect mix of steamy romance, emotion, light-hearted humor and suspense. 
 K. Bromberg really knows how to create broken characters who learn to put their past suffering behind them. Getty and Zander have been though so much pain you wonder if they will ever be able to open their hearts again. That pain is what makes their ultimate happiness so beautiful and meaningful. 
 'The invisible scars are the ones that cut the deepest and stay with you the longest.' 
 I fell in love with Zander in 'Down Shift' and his story was everything I hoped for: sexy, emotional, funny and very mature. Fans of the 'Driven' series will be thrilled to see Colton and Rylee make brief but pivotal appearances here but make not mistake, this is Zander and Getty's story. Get ready and JUST JUMP!

"In Asking for More, Jonah and Vivienne explore and test the boundaries of their relationship while finally allowing each other the freedom to truly be themselves. This novella adds a little something extra to one of my favorite erotic series and is a sexy and very explicit conclusion to this couple's story. 
 ""Am I the proof he can be good for someone? Or do our games prove to him that he'll never be free of the poison inside?"" 
 Many of the characters from the earlier books make an appearance here and this novella must be read in order or there will be major spoilers! I fell in love all over again with Jonah. *sigh* I adore Lilah Pace's writing and I can't wait for more books from her!

"BEAUTIFUL AND PASSIONATE! Brigs and Natasha were in love once, and then a terrible tragedy struck and Brigs completely broke things off with Natasha. She was devastated. THE LIE is told in flashback, and we see the beginnings of their love story through the present day. This is a gorgeous second-chance romance, which had me on pins and needles from the first paragraph. 
 Brigs is a tortured soul and I wasn't quite sure how the author was going to bring him together with Natasha. She barely escaped their break-up with her sanity intact and can't even begin to think about him being in her life again. Everything about Brigs is simply too painful for Natasha to deal with. 
 ""Memories of love are a poison. My therapist told me that I have to embrace it. Acknowledge that people fall in love all the time with people they aren't supposed to, that I was swept away and lost control for once in my life..."" 
 Brigs lives with crushing guilt for what happened to his family, but Natasha was the love of his life. What will he do now that she is in his life again? I was rooting for them from the beginning and read their story in one sitting. The writing is incredibly beautiful, soulful and passionate. 
 ""Tell me what I am to you,"" he whispers, leaning in closer. I suck in my breath. Afraid that if I exhale I'll let all my secrets loose. 
 I loved this book and loved the journey that Brigs and Natasha took in this story. THE LIE is yet another beautifully written story from Karina Halle!

"Nina Lane is one of THE most talented contemporary romance writers today. Her Spiral of Bliss series is one of my top favorite series, with outstanding characters, fantastic stories and one of THE sexiest couples I know, Liv and Dean. So I was more than excited to jump in to ADORE, the latest book in the series. Nina Lane has made me a fan of this sexy, real, gorgeous couple, with all of their problems and issues and yes, even humorous moments. 
 ""My love for my wife is powerfully intense and secure, bone-deep, the essential part of me. It's the solid ground under my feet, a feeling as inevitable as a sunrise. "" 
 Adore must be read in order, and takes place after Liv and Dean have married and are living in Mirror Lake. Liv is running a business and has a young child. Working moms will recognize Liv's constant juggling act but as much as I adore this writer, some of the scenes were a little jarring to me. As a wife and mother who has worked outside the home for almost 30 years, I found some of the scenes to be a little overdramatic and unnecessary. 
 With that said, Professor Dean West continues to be one of my favorite male characters. OMG is he sexy!!! His confidence, sexiness and intelligence make him absolutely irresistible. And make no mistake, Ms. Lane is a master at sexy, erotic writing. Even the funny scenes when Liv is totally frazzled are adorable. Dean truly worships Liv and will do anything to please her. All of Liv's careful planning seemed to go out the window when Dean receives the job offer of a lifetime. But he is ready to give it all up for his family? 
 ""I haven't had any best days with you."" 
 Why not? 
 ""Because you are my best day, beauty"". 
 Although some parts of the story moved slower than I wanted them to, I did love this book and will always devour anything Nina Lane writes. I hope that this is not the end of the story for Dean and Liv. I am not ready to give up Professor Dean West!

"WOW, what a totally surprising and inspiring read from Chelle Bliss!!! 
 The synopsis is purposefully vague and I won't give anything away here but the book begins with Callie waiting for a telephone call that could change her life. She is keeping a secret from everyone close to her and she realizes the call could be life-changing: 
 ""I'm on pins and needles waiting for an important phone call. One that could change my life, and I haven't told a soul about it. . . Telling people makes it real, and I'm not ready to face the possibility I could have more important things to deal with than which pair of shoes to wear with my favorite Donna Karan dress."" 
 Enter Bruno, a man who adores Callie and who is not at ALL what he seems to be. He refuses to let Callie sink into sadness and he pulls her into the light. Their love is absolutely beautiful and very real, and as with all of this author's books, family plays an important role in the main characters' lives. The warmth and love of Bruno's family is one of my favorite parts of this story. 
 The cover of this book is one the of most gorgeous covers I've even seen. It captures the themes of the book perfectly. Just when you think Callie is going to give up, Bruno is right there with her, supporting her and holding her up and giving her love. Callie shines with Bruno's tender loving care and the story is ultimately an uplifting one. 
 Make no mistake, this book deals with difficult themes and the story is very serious. But the two main characters are so filled with life and love, that it really turns out to be an extremely heart-warming story. I loved this book and I loved Callie and Bruno's strength and vulnerability. A truly inspiring story!!

"Okay I don't even know where to start with this! If you want something addictive, then read this. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. This book is not a romance, but there is plenty of sex; and in a way, it is strangely romantic, because of the heroine's hopeful outlook on relationships and love. 
 This is the story of young Aimee, who arrives in New York City from Oklahoma to start a new life. She meets Danny, a very powerful, much older man who sweeps her off her feet. There are several other very intriguing characters who may or may not become important in later parts of this story. The synopsis hints at dark turns but the first part is not all that dark; gritty, yes, but no sadism (yet!) The writing is very fast-paced and kept me engaged. 
 The non-linear timeline of this book threw me off balance and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a little disorienting but the real kicker is the ending! Or lack of one.

"This series is EVERYTHING!! Breathtaking romance, redemption, suspense, a sly sense of humor... this entire series just knocked the wind out of me!! This book was the perfect ending to the tale of Jackson and Jillian and all of the characters that I've grown to love through the course of three books. 
 Jillian Knight has become one of my favorite heroines ever. Damaged, feisty, strong-willed, smart and sarcastic, I was praying for her to have a happy ending!! And her unbreakable bond with her brother was absolutely brilliant. 
 ""In so many ways the greatest love story of her life was not with Luke or AJ ... it was with Jackson. He was the constant in her life. His love defined unconditional. Someday she would tell him ... someday."" 
 These two characters managed to fight their way out of almost unimaginable circumstances and both fought to find normalcy and happiness and love. That sounds sappy but there is not one false moment in this book and the author's writing literally took my breath away!! I could not put his story down until I found out what would happen to Jackson, Jillian, Ryn and Luke. Be wanted that there is graphic violence in this book, but it fit in with the storyline and the characters and it never felt gratuitous. 
 ""Control never lasted. Eventually the illusion of time, the pull of gravity, and catastrophic events reminded everyone of their mortality and their utter insignificance in the great big world. Life was nothing more than one long blink. Here today. Gone tomorrow."" 
 I have not binge-read a series of books in a very long time. This series was an exception, and I wish I could read these books all over again for the first time!! I ""ADORE"" this author and can't wait to read her other books.

"WOW!!! What a fascinating, twisty, surprising story!! I love KA Tucker's writing so I was very excited to read this one and it is VERY different from her other books. Adult, suspenseful, thrilling...with an ending that I never saw coming! This is one of those books that you will not put down until you are finished. It is told in flashbacks and in alternating POV's from Maggie and her best friend Celine's diary entries. Maggie does not believe her best friend committed suicide and begins investigating the circumstances surrounding Celine's death in New York City. She meets is all of the important people in Celine's life, including Jace, who may or may not be hiding something. There is also Grady, the very sexy building super, who is also under suspicion in Maggie's eyes. 
 I gingerly unfold the paper that's obviously been handled many times, judging by the crinkles in it. 
 My eyes widen. 
 A naked man fills one side. He's entrancingly handsome... lying on his back, one muscular arm disappearing into the pillow beneath his head, a white sheet tangled around his legs, not quite covering the goods... 
 Who the hell is this guy and why didn't I ever hear about him? And where is he now? Where were they together last? 
 Does he know that she's dead? 
 ... I slowly fold the paper back up. Celine's cursive scrawl decorates the back side in purple ink. Words I hadn't noticed before. 
 Words that make my heart stop now. 
 'This man was once my salvation. Now he will be my ruin.' 
 Maggie and Celine were childhood friends but grew apart once they got older. Maggie learns many things about Celine's life through reading her diaries and is convinced that the diaries will be the key to learning about her death. He Will Be my Ruin is a tightly written, taught suspense thriller that has a completely resolved ending and a smart, resourceful heroine. There's plenty of twists and turns to satisfy even the most jaded mystery reader. I loved this book and hope that KA Tucker writes more suspense in the future!!

But she is content to leave the spotlight to others, having suffered from stage fright most of her life. Enter Damon Atwood, a reclusive superstar who stepped away from the public spotlight at the height of his fame after years spent in a quiet fishing town. Damon will bring star power to the production and is paired with the gorgeous actress Alicia, who plays his co-star in the show. Rose instantly feels tremendous empathy for Damon, who is almost painfully shy in public but comes alive when singing and acting on the stage. 
 ""You have no idea the kind of betrayal I've suffered in my life... This friendship I have with you is a big deal. I haven't let someone into my life like I have you in years."" 
 SHOWMANCE is a very slow-burn romance, filled with stolen moments and tons of steamy, Alpha heat. Rose has sown off dating actors after being burned in past relationships. But Damon sees the beautiful soul that she is and can't help but fall in love with her. Although Damon is closed-off and shy in public, when he is alone with Rose, OMG!!! Their scenes together are absolutely unforgettable. 
 In a heartbeat, every look we'd shared flashed through my mind, from that initial fleeting glance across the dance studio the first time I'd heard him sing, to this one. This one told me I owned his heart, his soul, his everything. 
 This story has all the elements that I love: a smart and strong heroine, a damaged, sensitive hero and a creative, interesting plot. I loved the behind-the-scenes look into theatre production and the FANTASTIC cast of supporting characters, especially Rose's best friend Julian. I am THRILLED that Julian is getting his own book!!! I can't wait to see what the author does with this character. I could go on and on about this book, it is that perfect. L.H. Cosway is a brilliant writer and I devoured this book. It has the perfect mix of sexy, steamy scenes and just the right amount of angst. Don't miss this one!!!

"How I love Carnal!! 
 Just when I thought another Kristen Ashley hero could not break my heart any more than her earlier heroes, along comes Deke Hightower. A loner, almost a recluse, a man of very few words (the original strong, silent type!), Deke has had a hard, tough life, never putting down roots anywhere and never, ever opening his heart to a woman. He is a simple man, a lover of his bike and the open road, which he makes VERY clear to everyone he meets. Deke and Justice have a history together (he just doesn't remember it!!) but when they meet again years later, they have a verrrry slow build-up, and the slow burn worked perfectly for these two. There are lots of misunderstandings, lots of miscommunications, but when these two get together....OMG!!!! Expect the usual HAWTNESS and over-the-top Alpha-male sexiness that is pure Kristen Ashley. 
 One of the things I absolutely adored about this book was Deke. He is no kid (and neither is Justice), and Kristen Ashley describes him as all man and then some. 
 ""...All of it covering exceptional pecs and the most amazing stomach I'd ever seen. 
 Not abs. 
 A manly stomach. 
 I had to admit, I was over the cut leanness that was all the rage. In the beginning, it was hot. But now it seemed daunting, men being so developed they didn't have an inch of extra flesh on them, not like they were human beings but like they were diagrams of a body's muscularity. 
 Not Deke."" 
 *FAINTS* And Justice, I loved her! She is a gifted musician, with a renowned family but with lots and lots of heartache to go along with that. But this is Carnal and she is trying to hide out and get some peace. She hires Deke to renovate her new house and I think that Kristen Ashley must have a second secret career as a contractor. At first I thought there was too much detail about the house renovations but then I fell in love with the wonderful detail. Deke works with his hands, he takes pride in his work and the contrast between his blue-collar background and Justice's upbringing is both perfect and poignant at the same time. She has plenty of craziness to deal with, which Deke doesn't get at first. He really closes off his heart and Justice at first hides the fact that she remembers him from years before. He is almost sullen, but all of it comes from a place of heartbreak. 
 ""My life, babe,"" he shook his head, ""until I was about twenty, it was not good."" ""Okay,"" I prompted carefully, not liking that. ""And because a' that, I got a way I gotta be and that's a way that's not gonna change."" 
 > 
 All Justice wants is love and acceptance and some peace in her life. I loved that she was always herself around Deke, and eventually he warmed up to her cheerfulness, honesty and just plain goodness. It is difficult for a man like Deke to be with a brilliant and successful woman like Justice. But Deke, being Deke, accepts this in his own way. 
 He squatted and reached into the bag. 
 ""Open a beer for me, yeah?"" 
 ""I live to serve."" 
 Deke wanted to test that but do it when they were both naked. 
 Fuck him. 
 Total dumbfuck. 
 I must mention that FANTASTIC cast of secondary characters here. Each and every one felt fully developed and essential to the story. In my opinion, Kristen Ashley can pretty much write about anything and I will devour it. But when she writes about two people who have already lived a full life, who have their own demons and pasts, and who know what they want, well, to me that's a winner. Welcome back to Carnal, folks, it is a beautiful place. Enjoy the bounty. 
 ""I was living it and all I had to do was take care of it, nurture it, make it stronger. 
 Then it always would be mine. 
 Everything I'd ever wanted. 
 My place in this universe. 
 And it felt amazing.""

"4.5 STARS!! 
 NAZ IS BACK and wicked as ever. 
 I am in love with this series!!! The author continues to surprise by showing a ""little"" softer side of Naz here. Just a little. He is still as ruthless as ever but he remains fiercely loyal to Karissa. He stuggles to break free of his violent past for Karissa's sake, but let's face it, it is obvious he will never be completely free of that world. For that reason, I was on the edge of my seat throughout this whole book, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
 ""He wants to be a better man to ease my guilt for loving someone like him."" 
 This is a fast-moving, thrilling and violent plot, but completely and utterly sexy at the same time. Naz is absolutely one of THE sexiest, most controlling anti-heroes and I love him!!! This series is a must-read for fans of Mafia romance. It is tighly written, fast-paced, totally sexy and has great supporting characters. There is lots going on in this book and obviously the series must be read in order or there will be major spoilers. 
 J.M. Darhower is one of my go-to authors and this book delivers the goods. Buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride!!

"Absolutely astounding!!!! And the end was perfection. 
 HIDDEN BODIES begins where where YOU ended. For those of you who do not like cliffies, YOU wasn't really a cliffhanger and can absolutely be read as a standalone. However, for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg (and a little bit in love with him? Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story. 
 As funny as the author's commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don't fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost ""Being There"" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be. 
 And Joe is trying. He really is. But is still a complete and total sociopath. Despite that, I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES. But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions. This story is just as addictive and readable as YOU, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified but yet laughing out loud. Scary, funny, heartbreaking and amazing. Congrats to Caroline Kepnes for another perfect book.

"""In the depraved innards of my soul, I thrill at being the thing she fears. I want to claim her apprehension, dread, and uncertainty. I want to take ownership of all of her emotions and be the sole reason she trembles and cries."" 
 With those words, Pam Godwin has written on my favorite student-teacher dark romances. DARK NOTES is in the same category as UNTEACHABLE by Leah Raeder, with the rapid, short sentence style and the hopeless, yet hopeful, heroine. But Mr. Emeric Marceaux in in a class by himself (pun intended!) with his dark, dangerous and commanding nature. He knows what he wants and will do anything to make that happen. 
 Ivory is a feisty, but dirt-poor music student who is out of her element at the expensive and elitist music school she attends. She is a senior and is trying desperately to make it to graduation so that she can secure a spot at a prestigious music academy. But she is the poorest student at the school, forced to do anything to survive. She barely has money for new shoes or the school uniform, let alone textbooks or the required tablet. 
 Emeric is one commanding and bossy man. Whew. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book but my God, this man is irresistible. He never, ever mistreats Ivory, unlike most of the other men in her life, and his heart literally aches for the proud student who refuses to take charity from anyone. 
 ""All you need is a moment...This brutal man is my home. His hell is my heaven. I'm his Ivory, and he's my darkest note."" 
 Emeric became obsessed with Ivory and although he knew he had to stay away, they were both immediately connected and believe me, this girl needed his protection in the worst way. I love Emeric and was completely invested in him and his need to protect Ivory. This is without a doubt one of the sexiest forbidden love stories I've ever read. 
 There is a fantastic, brutal, emotional and violent storyline that is pure Pam Godwin. The New Orleans setting is perfection, and having lived there for many years, I am always thrilled when an author gets the setting of the story just right. New Orleans is almost another character in this book, with its humidity, class system, funky neighborhoods and diverse music scene. 
 Ivory is a feisty, strong heroine who will do whatever she needs to survive in her brutal world. She is no virginal, innocent heroine but she does have a refreshing honesty that I loved. Pam Godwin continues to be my go-to author for dark romance and DARK NOTES is just one more forbidden romance that hits all the right notes.

"4.5 - 5 SMOKING HOT STARS!! 
 OMG I loved this book!!! Perfect mix of total hawtness and great writing. Funny, sexy, engaging. . . not what I expected AT ALL. Laurelin Paige and Sierra Simone are the complete package. I highly recommend this one!! 
 Logan is a porn star but he really loves his job and makes no apologies for what he does. I loved the behind the scenes look into the porn industry and found it fascinating. Logan has had his heart broken by another adult film star but he has fantasized for years about Devi, who he met on set. Can two porn actors find true love together when their jobs involve having sex with other people? 
 Believe it or not, this book is actually full of romance along with the amazingly hot sex scenes and dirty talk. Logan is actually very sweet and Devi is filled with dreams of going back to school and maybe, just maybe, having a ""real"" relationship with Logan. They make a reality-tv type of film together which follows them as they pretend ""date"" but they both begin to fall for each other. The lines between their series and reality quickly become blurred. This book is filled with surprises and even has some very funny moments. I love both of these authors and their first book together is hot, sweet and a total guilty pleasure.

"3.5 - 4 Stars!! 
 Blake Austin's debut shows incredible promise and this author is definitely one to watch! 
 9 Letters is a story about real people facing real-life, heartbreaking issues. Luke is barely existing, living day to day after the very tragic loss of his young wife. He can't seem to pull himself together and get back to real life. He has distanced himself from his wife's family and is certainly not living up to his potential. How would Luke ever pull himself out of the depression he was in? He had his whole life in front of him but he seemed to have lost the will to go on and refused to really engage with anyone around him. 
 ""I didn't know how to fix my life, sure. I could fix a lot of things, but I couldn't fix my life. Lives aren't like houses. You can't paint over your problems. There's no rustoleum for life."" 
 Luke receives a package a year after his wife has passed away. She has written him nine letters, but each one contains certain instructions and the next letter cannot be opened until he completes the task in each letter. Her first letter instructs him to get a dog. It is during this task that he meets Rae, a beautiful volunteer at the animal shelter. He is immediately drawn to her but their path is not as predictable as I thought it would be. 
 I found 9 Letters to be an original and very poignant storyline and loved seeing if and when Luke would carry our his late wife's instructions. She wanted him to move on with his life, find love again and just seemed to anticipate that he would not deal well with her death. This is a very promising debut novel, with a very engaging storyline and characters. It is a fairly fast read and while I would have liked to see a little more character development, I really liked the story and the down-to-earth tone of the book. And of course, I loved the focus on dogs and animal rescue! Blake Austin has a very bright future as an author and I recommend this book if you are looking for a story that offers lots of emotion but also a very optimistic conclusion.

"4 SEXY, FUN STARS!! 
 I will admit I did not think I would love this book as much as I did!! I am a HUGE fan of Alessandra Torre's writing, but I really thought this story might be a little too ""fluffy"" for me. I was completely wrong!! It is sexxxxxy, fun, sarcastic, witty and a love letter to New York City. The formatting of the book is gorgeous and very, very clever. 
 Chloe lived a pampered life as part of New York City's wealthy elite. As an NYU student, she never had worry about such trivial things as money or tuition. All of that comes to a screeching halt when her parents lose everything after being assessed of insider trading. But Chloe is nothing if not resourceful and finds a job as a personal assistant to a spoiled, mean and self-centered socialite, who also thinks of herself as an actress. 
 ""The wealth of the city lived in a different bubble than the rest of us. One where there were no worries of minor problems, the majority of which were easily solved by money. One comprised of beautiful women, powerful men, the drug of success heavy in the air, punctuated by diamond, caviar, and ego. For the first time, I was an outsider..."" 
 Alessandra Torre writes some of my favorite books. She can be dark, twisty, and imaginative, and Love, Chloe shows what a versatile writer she is. This is a light, funny, romantic, fast-paced story, but with so many clever touches, that I enjoyed it immensely. Each chapter begins with an Instagram picture that were a perfect addition to the story. They set the tone for the next chapter and what was going on in Chloe's life. 
 This is a standalone novel and it delves not only into the world of New York City socialites, but also into the making of a movie, A-List and B-List actors and trying to survive in the Big City. Chloe has had to grow up fast and complicating things is her old boyfriend who keeps making unwanted appearances in the new life she is trying to make for herself. 
 Maybe the cultured, confident woman I was before was just a product of my parents' money. Maybe now, with my new life a train wreck, I would discover the real Chloe Madison. 
 And maybe, I wouldn't like her. 
 Maybe it wasn't too late for me. 
 Maybe all this was just my wakeup call. 
 Chloe finally finds an apartment that she can afford on her own, now that she is gainfully employed, and wouldn't you know it, she has a HOT super who just turns out to be a NICE guy on top of all that hotness!! And of course you know that you will be treated to some SIZZLING sex scenes. Carter is a total doll and it is obvious he really likes Chloe. I loved that she was insecure, that she really ended up being a hard worker, that she did the ""right thing"" in the end (you'll see what I mean) and that Alessandra Torre gives her a happy ending that she deserves. Does she ALWAYS make the right choices? No. But Love, Chloe is a little ""slice-of-life"" very modern book that is immensely enjoyable. The author continues to surprise with her ability to write across different genres. If you are looking for a very fast-paced book with humor, heart and tons of steam, Love, Chloe is defintely for you! 
 ""I love you, Chloe. Everything else fades away from that.""

"3.5 - 4 Stars!! 
 There is so much to love about this book! The heroine is funny, feisty, different, and not afraid to be herself. The dialogue is sharp and Graham is devlishly sexy. The story begins with a creative premise: a lost cellphone on a train. Our heroine Soraya and Graham immediately clash when she goes to his offices to return his phone. He is a total asshole at work but he loves that she argues with him and isn't afraid of him at all. 
 Soraya works for an advice columnist, doesn't love her job and has not had a successful sex life. She rides the train to and from work every day from her apartment in Brooklyn and that is how she first spots Graham. But these two could not more different! 
 ""My life was far from Sex and the City. It was more like Sex and the Pity. Or Sex and the Shitty."" 
 There are lots of funny one-liners in this story and the plot is very fast-paced. Graham loves that Soraya is pierced and dyes the tips of her hair in wild colors. Different from the stuffy women he has been with in the past. I loved the major twist in the middle of this book: it injected lots of emotion and heart into this story. 
 I loved the New York City setting but several unrealistic plot points interefered with my enjoyment of the story. These authors are wonderful at creating memorable characters and Stuck-Up Suit is no exception. The chemistry is explosive and the sexy times are very, very hot. 
 ""It would be my pleasure to leave the gentleman at the door and fuck you four ways dirty."" 
 This book is perfect if you want a sexy, funny, fast-paced contemporary romance that offers an escape from reality for a few hours. And kudos to Ms. Ward and Ms. Keeland for creating a heroine who marches to the beat of her own drummer!

"I have read four of the stories so far and they are FANTASTIC. This anthology contains stories by my favorite writers, so what could be bad about a book filled with their short stories?? And all for only 99 cents! 
 His First and Only by Alexa Riley ~ A sweet and hot read about a wealthy hotelier who has spent years looking for his first love, after they were separated as teenagers. She is now an exotic dancer in Las Vegas and he will stop at nothing to reclaim what he has lost. Not as steamy as other Alexa Riley stories but as always, this has a HEA and an sexy Alpha male. 
 Advent by Nina Lane ~ ""Let me in, beauty,"" Dean whispered hotly against my ear, his finger still gently teasing. ""I'll make it so good for you."" OMG!! DEAN WEST!! I adored this story of Liv and Dean!! Nina Lane is an unparalleled erotic romance writer and this story reminded me why I love her so much. The Spiral of Bliss series is a must-read! Professor Dean West and his student Olivia have just embarked on their passionate affair. She is young and unworldly, and he is a sophisticated university professor. The ending of this story was absolutely perfect. 
 It Takes Two by Nikki Sloane ~ ""Nina Hale, the girl who couldn't get anything better than an entry-level temp job, was about to go down in flames, and Nina the porn star would rise in her place."" Hot menage, anyone? Somehow Nikki Sloane makes the story of a threesome on a porn set seem actually very real and kind of sweet. The three main characters are believable and their scenes together almost burn up the page. You will need a cold shower after reading this one! 
 Trailer Park Eden by C.J. Roberts ~ An incredibly affecting story about two disabled siblings growing up in deplorable conditions. Taboo love done right. And if these two don't get their own full-length book, then we must start a petition on Change.org immediately! Just kidding. Sort of. Incredibly sweet, sexy and very emotional story from the Mistress of Dark Romance herself. I really want to see more about these two unforgettable characters.

"This was my first book by Amy Daws and I loved it! I have not read her London Lovers series, so I can say that this one can defenitely be read as a standalone. I was immediately drawn into this book from the beginning and loved the story. The book alternates between Reyna's days at university and present day. This can be tricky but works perfectly here. 
 This is Reyna and Liam's story. It is clear from the beginning of that Reyna has suffered terrible heartbreak and the pieces of her past slowly come together throughout the story. I absolutely loved the steamy scenes between Reyna and Liam and also adored the surprising insight into the mother-daughter relationship. There is obviously something causing an issue between Reyna and her mom and the revelation and resolution was quite a surprise to me. 
 ""Life is a gift, Reyna. Mistakes happen."" My mother says, finally. Her blue eyes and fair skin shimmer from the overhead lamp light as she attempts to drive her point into me. ""We can't control life anymore than we can control the hands of time. They both continue without our intervention."" 
 I loved Liam as the main character here but also adored Hayden and his relationship with Reyna. While he ultimately wasn't good for her, their journey was their own and I truly felt heartbroken for his own personal struggles. 
 But make no mistake, this is Reyna and Liam's story. From the beginning, I knew they were irrevocably bound but I did not know if Reyna could ultimately overcome her issues with self-respect and her inability to to open up to others. 
 ""You saw me better than I ever saw myself and you pushed me back. Just when everyone else would give up, you would push through. I want to be everything you see in me. I want my insides to match my outsides...perfectly imperfect...just as long as it's with you."" 
 NOT THE ONE is overall a very sexy and emotional book. The story took me by surprise and it is a refreshingly creative story. I love Amy Daws' writing style and look forward to reading more of her books!

"Poignant story, beautifully written!! 
 As part of my New Year's resolutions, I am determined to try new authors to me, so I gladly jumped at the chance to read In the Wind by Author Lilliana Anderson, a truly poignant, coming-of-age story with a surprising mix of forbidden love and deep emotion. 
 Dawn is a square peg, just finishing high school and anxiously waiting for her university acceptance with her best friend, Zeke. They can't wait to get out of their beautiful but small and confining beach town. Dawn and Zeke have been friends for years but she yearns for more. She is in love with him but cat get him to look at her as anything more than a fiend. He has been her saving grace since he moved in. Along comes Shea, a wild girl who is new in town. At this point I assumed the story would go in one direction, and it took several very unexpected turns. What I thought would be a sweet, New Adult romance turned into an emotional, angsty story that kept me turning the pages until the very end. 
 Dawn is fascinated by her new friend Shea, who is a free spirit and is the complete opposite of careful, deliberate Dawn. Shea awakens certain feelings in Dawn but Shea is harboring some very dark secrets which all come crashing down in the end. You just know Shea is trouble, but Dawn has to find out for herself. I actually felt sorry for Shea after her real story comes to light. 
 ""...every time she opened her mouth, an intelligence spilled from her lips that I hadn't expected when I first saw her twirling in the wind and the rain."" 
 Every scene in this book is unforgettable. I loved how Zeke and Dawn's relationship evolved from best friends to something more, and how Shea turned out to be not all that she seemed to be. Dawn had some hard choices to make in this story, and I was often surprised by where Ms. Anderson took her characters. Not at all the sweet story I was expecting, IN THE WIND is nonetheless a wonderfully poignant story about finding your true self and learning to leave your past behind. I loved Dawn's journey toward self-discovery. The seaside setting is so moody and descriptive and I felt a little lost after I finished this book. The ending of this story was perfect for the characters. All in all, a very surprising and satisfying read from a wonderfully talented author!

"4 - 4.5 STARS! 
 Sweetly smart romance with a magnificent hockey-playing hero! Who wouldn't fall in love with Tucker? 
 This sexy NA/Sports Romance series was just what I needed to read right now: fast-paced, funny, light, with just the right touch of sweetness and steam. Tucker was a doll: a good boy who really loved Sabrina and wanted to stand by her no matter what when a surprise pregnancy interrupts their no-strings-attached relationship. Tucker was a fabulous hockey player with a bright future ahead of him but like Sabrina, he knows what he wants, too, and he goes after it. 
 Sabrina has her goals set in stone: attend Harvard Law and then go on to work in a large, prestigious law firm. She works multiple jobs, studies hard and doesn't have much time for anything else. Her home life is the pits and she can't wait to get far away from her family. Tucker and Sabrina were perfect together! The steam factor is off the charts in this book!! 
 ""Oh sweet baby Jesus. Sex with Tucker is dirtier and hotter than I thought it would be. He doesn't look like he'd be this way, but isn't it always the quiet ones?"" 
 Tucker was patient, yet a bit stalker-ish (thank God!) and overall, 'The Goal' is another wonderfully-written story from Elle Kennedy. And the cover!! Hello, abs!! The secondary characters are strong and I loved seeing the characters from the earlier books here. With that said, you do not need to have read the earlier books in the series to love and enjoy 'The Goal'. I loved the message here and the Epilogue was soooo sweet! Thanks, Elle, for another sexy couple in the Off-Camput Series!

"Short, sweet, and oh-so-sexy, this hot novella certainly lives up to all the hype! Laura Kaye writes an engrossing, steamy and emotional tale of two strangers trapped in a darkened elevator. Caden is a tattooed, pierced and emotionally damaged man who is afraid of how the straight-laced accountant Makenna might judge him once the lights come on. This has just as much impact as a full-length contemporary romance novel.

"4 - 4.5 GRUMPY, SEXY STARS!! 
 ""The massiveness of his body was such a turn-on. He was an unyielding wall of a man. I just wanted to stay right here - literally pressed between a rock and a hard place. Forever."" 
 WELL HELLO, GRUMPY BEARDED FARMER!! Sarina Bowen NEEDS to write more adult contemporary romance! OMG Griffin is one of THE sweetest and sexiest heroes EVER. Adored the story. Sexy, funny and smart. Fabulous beginning to what I'm sure will be a fantastic series!! 
 I absolutely loved this story about Griff, a super-hot and always-grumpy farmer who lives and works with his large family on their farm in Vermont. I loved the wonderful details about apple farming, organic farming and the agricultural business!! This eye for detail just shows what an incredibly talented writer Sarina Bowen is. 
 Audrey is struggling to make her mark in the Boston restaurant world and is called upon to visit several farms in Vermont as part of her job. She runs into Griif, with whom she had a few hot hook-ups in college. Back then he was a superstar football player, but he thought she was a sorority party girl and she thought he would never be interested in someone like her. 
 Flash forward to the present, Audrey is trying to make it on her own without the help of her wealthy mother. Her bosses aren't exactly ethical in their business dealings, which Griff makes quite clear to her. BUT these two have some AMAZINGLY hot chemistry and can't seem to stay away from each other. I must say that Sarina Bowen surprised me with the heat level in BITTERSWEET!!! Griff is hot, sweet, huge and BEARDED. Audrey is hooked! But these two could not be more different: Griff is serious, usually grumpy and completely immersed in running his farm and the business side of farming, while Audrey, who is smart and driven, is funny, outgoing and much more of a people person. 
 ""You're the sweet that balances out my natural tannins."" 
 Griff is my kind of hero. Hardworking, sexy, sweet, devoted to his family...and when he opens up to Audrey and shows his true feelings, OMG!!! Perfection. 
 ""There was nothing I wouldn't have given her at that moment. Skin to skin with her was the only place I wanted to be."" 
 There is an incredible cast of supporting characters, I would love to read a story about each and every one. BITTERSWEET has humor, heat, wonderful writing and and a fast paced story. And plenty of sexy times to satisfy even the most jaded of contemporary romance readers (like me!) The only thing that kept this book from being a 5 star read for me was a scene early on that I felt was out of place in a sexy contemporary romance story. Other than that, I highly recommend this sweet, sexy and funny story!! Can't wait to read the next book in this series!!

"""You see something in me you think is worth cleansing, polishing, making shiny. Worth preserving, like one of your antiques. I'm an antique all right. Broken casting, rusty insides, faulty wiring."" 
 BLOOD & RUST is one of those books that I read slowly because I didn't want it to end!! The fourth book in the Lock & Key series is a gorgeous, very adult and very sexy story of two souls who are looking for redemption and happiness. Cat Porter is hands-down one of my very favorite writers and she has bought yet another beautiful story to life. 
 I can't recommend this series highly enough. Filled with memorable characters, lasting relationships and incredible writing, each book is a treasure. So you could read BLOOD & RUST as a standalone, but these books are fantastic and intricately written so you will get a real flavor of the history of each character and of club life. 
 Tania and Butler are both looking for a fresh start in South Dakota. Butler has led a rough life, filled with terrible mistakes and tragedy. He is much older now, and is trying to rebuild the loyalty and trust of his brothers, He will do anything to work his way back into the good graces of the club, even if that means giving up his chance at love and happiness. He is a tragic figure, and he broke my heart!! One of the things I adore about Cat Port is that her protagonists are older and have lived a very full life. 
 Tania had a brief but unforgettable encounter with Butler years earlier. Now they are both trying to start new in Meager, South Dakota. Tania has left an empty and soulless marriage behind, and is finally pursuing her passion. She knows she behaved badly with Butler all those years before, but will he be bale to overcome his past demons and give her the love she deserves? Will Tania be able to overcome the alomst-insumountable obstacles that stand in the way of her happiness? 
 ""We kissed like enemies clanging swords on a battlefield littered with our dead. We were the only survivors locked in the final battle, both of us knowing there would be no victors."" 
 I absolutely fell in love with Butler!! No one writes a tortured hero like Cat Porter. He is very complex and truly believes that real love is outside his grasp. He has put aside his own personal happiness for the sake of the club. This is a slow-burn romance which only makes things all the sweeter when Butler and Tania finally get together. These are two very mature adults who know what they want and Butler is ALL about pleasing his queen Tania. 
 He still had that rugged rough and tumble exterior, but now, he was...intriguing. The kind of intriguing that was making my toes curl and my purse jump at this very moment. 
 The banter in this book is priceless and no detail is overlooked!! I loved how the setting of South Dakota is almost another character in the book. The scenery is described in very vivid detail. The ending for these characters was just perfect. If you are a fan of MC romance, then this entire series is a must-read!! Now I will wait impatiently for more stories from this incredible storyteller.

"""For good or bad, all roads led back to him. Perhaps that's what it meant to really be his."" 
 I could not. Put. This. Book. Down. Simply out, this book grabbed me from the beginning and I haven't been able to stop thinking about Emily and Reeve since I finished. FIRST TOUCH is without a doubt one of my favorite books of the year. It is stunning and a true page-turner! 
 The plot, the pacing, the hotter-than-hot sex scenes, the emotion, the characters...all pure perfection. I love Laurelin Paige's writing but with FIRST TOUCH, she has written the best book of her career. Run, don't walk, to buy this book! 
 I absolutely love a damaged heroine when written well. Emily is an incredibly real, thoughtful, smart and beautiful woman, who lived a very fast and dangerous lifestyle when she was young. Her ""partner in crime"" was her best friend Amber, with whom she lost touch but who has now reached out to Emily. Amber represents a part of Emily's past that she'd like to put behind her, but Emily is forced into using her beauty and charm once again in order to seduce the man she believes might hold the clues to Amber's whereabouts. 
 ""Men were my drug. Staying away from them had been the only way I knew to stay clean. The only way to reinvent myself."" 
 Amber has disappeared, is somehow in danger and Emily feels she owes it to Amber to help her. Amber did the same for Emily many times when they were younger, and Emily senses that Amber needs her now. To that end, Emily sets her sights on wealthy hotelier Reeve, who might be the only link she has to Amber. Reeve, it seems, is only interested in a purely sexual arrangement with the alluring Emily. But Emily can't help but fall for the hot, yet emotionally reserved playboy. 
 ""His grip was strong and sure and aggressive. Almost too tight, but just barely not. He held it without saying anything for several seconds, and, I don't know how-- somehow, though-- I knew he was making his own allusion. His own promise. He wanted me to know what he'd be like. In bed. With me. He'd be powerful and controlling and forceful, even. Almost too forceful, but just barely not. Was that how he'd been with her? Did almost become too much?"" 
 This book is part erotic romance, part thriller, part romantic suspense...FIRST TOUCH has it all. There are some VERY graphic sex scenes in this book and the steam factor is off the charts!! But there is much more to this story than just the erotic elements. My heart absolutely ached for the suffering Emily had endured; and I was literally holding my breath in anticipation throughout the story, hoping against hope that she and Reeve would develop real feelings for each other, beyond their agreed-upon sexual arrangement. Emily's pretend seduction of Reeve quickly turns into something more and she knows that Reeve represents the possibility of a real connection, real feelings, but he is hiding many secrets of his own. 
 ""Because the only thing worse than falling under Reeve's spell would be me believing that he'd fallen under mine as well."" 
 There is a large cast of characters in FIRST TOUCH - some might be dangerous, some might not be, and some might know what happened to Amber. One thing is for sure, nothing is as it seems in FIRST TOUCH. And that is what makes this such an outstanding story.

"""Hindsight-- it's a motherfucker, ain't it?"" 
 SO happy to read this gem of a story! I remembered why Jake and Tru and The Mighty Storm are among my favorite characters. Emotional, witty and sexy, The Storm is a must-read for fans of The Mighty Storm series. 
 I absolutely LOVE when my favorite characters are brought back for a little ""something more."" If done well, I can't get enough. And Samantha Towle has written a perfect novella that captures the essence of Jake, Tru and The Mighty Storm. There are no ""fillers"" here, only genuine emotion, a great story, some drama and fantastic conclusion to the story of The Might Storm. 
 There is a huge twist to this story that is completely unexpected and perfect for Jake and Tru. If you have a few hours, I highly recommend this story. This book cements my love for Jake as one of my all-time favorite book boyfriends. There is a depth to this novella that for me, was a pleasant surprise. Don't miss this wonderful addition to The Mighty Storm series.

"3.5 - 4 Stars 
 This is the very sexy and very sweet sequel to the short story, Hearts in Darkness. This book picks up shortly after Caden and Makenna first met in the darkened elevator. They have developed an almost-perfect relationship - and this book is verra verra steamy - but Caden has severe PTSD due to a very shocking incident in his past that has completely traumatized him. 
 This is one of those stories where the hero doesn't think he is good enough for the heroine - she is smart, kind, beautiful, has a wonderful family, etc. - so the hero must distance himself from her ""for her own good."" Makenna loves Caden but realizes that he is gun-shy and she is scared to make her true feelings known. When she does, all hell breaks loose. 
 This is a lovely, steamy story with lots of angst and a beautiful HEA. If you are a fan of Laura Kaye's writing, then you will love this book.

"Slip of the Tongue is absolutely enthralling. Jessica Hawkins continues to be one of the most underrated contemporary romance authors today. I ADORED this book!!! 
 I am personally a fan of love triangles in books - I know, a little strange, but I love the emotion, the forbidden-love aspect and and the thrill of it all. So if you are not a fan, then this book is probably not for you. Sadie has been married to an amazing man who has suddenly and inexplicably shut down. Nathan has stopped communicating with Sadie, seems to not want her anymore, and pretty much just shuts her out. She tries to get through to him, to no avail. Enter sexy neighbor Finn, who is smart, sweet, and makes his intentions very clear from the start. 
 I have LOVED this author's writing ever since I read her Cityscape series (which I highly recommend.) Ms. Hawkins made me FEEL Sadie's insecurities, her inner battles and her fear of losing her husband and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster from the first page of this book. This is a very adult and very passionate book where not all is black-and-white. Yes, Nathan seems perfect and yes, Sadie makes some mistakes, but she is human and I found the story to be very believable. I loved Finn and could see why Sadie was so conflicted. She love her husband but feels like her marriage is over. All of the characters in this book are incredibly well written and I connected with them from the start. 
 Finn and Sadie have explosive chemistry AND so do Sadie and Nathan! The sex scenes are absolutely incredible. I loved everything about this book and loved the conclusion. Kudos to Jessica Hawkins for another incredibly sexy and addictive story.

"Sweet, SEXXXY, funny...JOCKBLOCKED has all this and more!! Jen Frederick has a gift for sparkling dialogue and nuanced characters that elevate her books to the top of the sports-romance genre. This story is funny, fast-paced and shows off the author's deep love and knowledge of the sport of football. Lucy and Matty are adorable and the sex scenes were waaaaay steamier than I expected. And the banter between these two is priceless! 
 ""I know how to cook, and have, at some points in my life, operated an iron."" He ticks off each skill on a finger. ""I always bring the good booze when I'm invited to a party, and I make my bed in the morning."" 
 ""You had me at know how to cook."" 
 Who doesn't love a gorgeous, smart athlete who's also senstive, depsite his party-boy reputation? Matty is one of the author's most endearing characters. Lucy is hilarious, and her inner dialogue is pure gold. 
 The girls must have spotted Matt because they bypass three open tables to walk by ours. As they pass, there's a contest of who can flip her hair over her shoulder the hardest. I swear the last two eye fuck him so hard, it's a wonder they make it to their own table upright. 
 There's a very sweet twist to this story, and I found the peek into the inner workings of a college football team fascinating. If you want a well-written, fresh college romance, without unrealistic and unecessary drama, pick up JOCKBLOCKED. It is part of an internconnected series but can defintely be read as a standalone. And be prepared for Matty to steal your heart!! 
 He watches me while I pull on my coat. ""You're right that there's nothing wrong with how you're living. I'm not judging that. I'm just saying maybe your life could be happier. And that sometimes taking a risk gives you big rewards."" 
 ""And you're that big reward?""

"Good lord!! Alexa Riley's books are like an addiction and if you have about 30 minutes to spare, these stories are EXPLOSIVE!! And yes, totally unbelievable but highly enjoyable.

"""You're the only one I let know me. I never fell out of love, Dais. I just fell out of touch. I'm here now. I'm back and I'm here to stay."" 
 I can honestly say that these books are among my all-time favorites. Dare I say they are life-changing? These are the kind of books that stay with you long after you finish the final chapter. And hello, I don't think I have ever SOBBED while reading Acknowledgements, but once again, the author got me with that one. 
 All of the beloved characters in The Fish Tales series really come full circle in 'Here to Stay'. This is an epic story and I absolutely adored how the author wrote these characters with such passion, heartbreak and LIFE. I devoured every page of this book and once again, it was pure perfection. 
 'Here to Stay' delves into the relationship not only between Daisy and Erik, but also between Erik and Will. I swear I could read an entire series just based on Will and Lucky!! That's how much I LOVE these characters. This book is all about Erik repairing his broken relationships and regaining everyone's trust again. Every word, every scene is precious and beautiful. Real life happens to these characters in ""Here to Stay'. Some of it is grand, some of it is funny, some of it is absolutely heart-wrenching and all of it is messy. Just like real life. 
 He reached to touch the hollow of her throat where the gold fish and the pearl nestled. 
 ""You're the best thing to ever happen to me twice."" 
 Suanne Laqueur needs to be on everyone's TBR list. These books are simply magnificent and I have no doubt that the upcoming 'An Exaltation of Larks' will be just as mesmerizing. I truly feel that I have lived along with these fictional characters over the course of this series. Every fan of second-chance romance needs to read The Fish Tales ASAP. They will change your life!

"""I love you, I will always love you,"" Daisy said. ""And I am... And I am moving on."" 
 Dear Ms. Laqueur: 
 Thank you very much but I have a massive book hangover after reading Daisy's story. Extraordinary!!! Daisy's story is everything I hoped it would be! It was simply magical. 
 While I am always up for a re-telling, that is NOT what this book was and I applaud your beautiful storytelling. I was entranced by your technique of having Daisy speaking with her therapist several years ahead of the last book, and by Daisy telling her story through her own eyes. SO much was revealed! I am just in awe of your creativity. 
 ""Try to find a beginning,"" the therapist says. ""Or just start somewhere. We can go forwards or backwards, it doesn't matter. You don't have to give me the perfect story arc."" 
 I absolutely adored seeing Erik Fiskare through Daisy's eyes. You made her love, her pain, her despair and her hope and recovery feel so REAL. I felt like I KNEW Daisy, and all of the characters, personally. I don't know how you wrote such another magnificent book but you skipped all the tired old cliches and made this another incredibly unique story. Can I say that I would even love a story about Ray? I fell in love with him. There were just so many gorgeous stories in this book! 
 Your descriptions of ballet and dance were magnificent. I felt like I was in the theater with your characters, feeling their passion. Please excuse my gushing but I am just in awe of your writing! And thank you for keeping up the characters' sharp and biting sense of humor. The wit was a welcome relief from some of the almost unbearably heartbreaking events of the story. I hope you never stop writing! Thank you for another perfectly written story. 
 I am sorry, I love you and I forgive myself.",10,5,1,323,17.08,49.26,51.06,99.0,10.77,18.27,91.02,75.54,59.44,20.43,16.41,8.05,0.31,5.26,2.48,0.31,4.02,13.93,4.64,0.0,10.84,8.98,6.81,6.81,1.55,18.89,6.19,3.72,2.17,1.24,0.62,0.31,14.55,1.86,12.07,2.79,0.93,2.17,2.17,1.86,3.1,0.0,10.53,9.29,1.24,5.26,4.02,1.24,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.0,20.43,11.76,1.86,2.48,0.0,0.31,7.12,8.67,0.0,0.0,2.48,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.48,0.93,0.0,1.55,0.0,0.0,2.48,1.86,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.62,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.31,1.24,5.57,8.05,0.0,1.24,4.02,1.24,0.31,1.86,3.72,6.19,5.26,1.55,0.31,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,19.81,8.05,3.72,0.31,2.48,2.17,3.1,0
"""Some seek the limelight and some hold the light in place."" 
 I just knew this book would be mesmerizing and I was right! Completely, utterly, and totally captivating. I can't even gather my thoughts together to write a coherent review. One of the most heartfelt but smart and honest romances I have ever read! Everyone needs to read this book. It is EPIC. 
 I will never forget this book. The author stole my heart and I am not sure I will ever get it back again. I don't think that I have ever read a more beautiful and terrifying description of falling in love. When Erik and Daisy meet, their whole worlds change. BUT there is no ""insta-love"" here, just a perfect description of love unfolding and growing and binding them together. 
 ""I don't know where I stop and you begin."" 
 I didn't really read this book so much as I EXPERIENCED it. The Man I Love is the epic story of Daisy, Erik, their close friends and their family through the years, starting with college. Daisy is a gifted ballet dancer and Erik is the theater tech who lights her shows. Excuse me, her CONCERTS (inside joke if you have read the book.) Let me just say that the description of music, ballet, dancers, artists and instructors is absolutely magical. There were simply no extraneous words or overblown descriptions. I literally felt as if I was physically present in the theater, or at rehearsals or in the room with Erik and Daisy. 
 As stunning and magical as the prose is, the story knocked me out and completely left me a wreck. It is messy and beautiful and painful, just like real life. 
 I absolutely love books that span years. The Man I Love begins with the characters just learning about life and love and loss and spans into adulthood. Every character was meaningful and funny and real and human, even the ones that weren't so nice. I felt sympathetic to all of the characters. 
 I won't repeat the plot here but read this as I did: I knew the synopsis but I never, ever expected this book to get under my skin like it did. There is no unnecessary drama or false notes, just perfect writing. Daisy and Erik's love was more than love. They could not breathe without each other. Theirs is not a perfect love story, all tied up neatly with a bow. But it was all-consuming. 
 ""And though it wasn't anything close to true love, or even false love, the encounter seemed to fix the coordinates for Erik's place in the universe."" 
 I basically want to just tell everyone to READ THIS BOOK! The Man I Love is without a doubt one of my top favorites of all time, and I have read a lot of books. It has sweet first love, wonderful, fully-realized characters, a thrilling plot plus THE most amazing writing I have encountered in quite some time. Reading this book was more like taking an emotional journey than just simply reading. I am jumping right into the second book in the series, Give Me Your Answer True, which is Daisy's side of the epic story of this unforgettable couple. I highlighted so many parts of this book that I could literally fill another book with my favorite parts! Here is one of my favorites: 
 ""You think about someday, you prepare mentally for someday. But someday is never today. And now it is."" 
 I applaud Suanne Laqueur for this astounding and gorgeous story!

"4.5 STARS!!!! 
 WOW!!!! There are lots of contemporary erotic romances out there but Nikki Sloane has quickly become one of my favorite authors in the genre. Regan and Silas burn up the pages in THREE DIRTY SECRETS!!!! Silas is just, well, irresistible. A hunky, smart, artistic, and Alpha tattoo artist?? Sign me up. 
 This isn't the tired old girl-meets-guy, girl-loses-guy, girl-gets-guy back story. Regan is working as an undercover FBI agent in the Blindfold Club, which is really a side story to the main event of her sizzling romance with Silas Getty. She is an aggressive cop and Silas is aggressive, too, so what to do with that?! Nikki Sloane wraps it all up pretty nicely in this steamy, sexy story. 
 ""We had heat by the truckload, but this was something else. Passion. So different, and so much better."" 
 Regan is still reeling from a prior undercover operation gone wrong so she is distant with Silas, reserved in her emotions but he is passionate and loves that Regan is a tough-talking, no-nonsense woman. She is afraid of falling for him but quickly that he might just be THE perfect man for her. 
 ""I'd failed all of my objectives when it came to Silas.. . and I hadn't outlined any ground rules about keeping things between us casual. Last Sunday had been anything but casual."" 
 THREE DIRTY SECRETS is as much of a romantic suspense as it is a BDSM-themed book, the action is fast-paced and the sex scenes are absolutely incendiary. This book is for mature readers only!! There are threesomes that are scorching hot and main characters who are passionate, driven and not afraid to take what they want. I highly recommend this story, it is another winner in the Blindfold Club Series!! 
 FAVORITE QUOTE: 
 My mouth opened, but his hand slapped over it, silencing me. His expression was wild, like a man pushed to the brink. He looked dangerous, and fucking gorgeous. ""I couldn't wait any longer,"" he muttered. ""Deal with it."" Beneath his palm, I smiled. I'd met my match in Silas, hadn't I?

">4.5 Sweet & Steamy Stars!! 
 Cardeno C. is one of my favorite authors. Her books always contain a perfect mix of spicy and sweet, and the heat level is always just perfect for me. Her stories are always interesting, sometimes poignant, but never fail to contain a ton of heart so I absolutely love reading them. This book is the first in a series but can be read as a standalone. Asher is a dominant cop but this story just touches on BDSM themes, nothing too heavy here. Asher meets a younger man while in Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Daniel is the COMPLETE opposite of Asher! He's a free spirit, but he too is very attracted to Asher. 
 Asher's protective tendencies come to the forefront with Daniel but the problem is Daniel is looking for a relationship, and Asher, not so much. I loved seeing how the relationship between these two changed and grew. AS with all Cardeno C. books, the characters are EVERYTHING and Daniel and Asher do not disappoint. Just look at this gorgeous cover for a hint of the steam level of this story, it is a perfect mix of total hotness and sentimental sweetness. Some readers complained about the stalker-ish tendencies of Asher but I didn't get that at all. He is just a big bear of a man trying to find his way to true love (awwwwww!!). 
 Something in the Way He Needs is another perfectly sexy romance from Cardeno C. with just the right touch of emotion and steam! I loved it. If you are looking for an author to read with wonderfully satisfying characters and storylines, then grab this book! You'll love it, too.

"""Never pass up the opportunity to make a beautiful memory, Drew.""

 I'm a sucker for holiday romances and Emma Chase delivers the goods here. A holiday short story featuring Drew Evans and his trademark sarcasm and humor? What's not to love? A play on the classic A Christmas Carol, this short story shows us what Drew's life would be like without his beloved Kate. And you can almost smell the evergreen in this funny, sexy and oh-so-sweet holiday tale. As an added bonus, there's a deleted scene between Drew and Kate and a sneak peek from Appealed , coming in January 2016. 
 So grab your favorite drink, put on some holiday music and enjoy this sweet, sexy story!

Amelia and Justin haven't had any contact with each other in years - literally - so she feels compelled to sneak a peek at the man she is going to be owning a house with. 
 ""He's...gorgeous. Absolutely freaking gorgeous."" 
 Covering my face, I said, ""Jesus. Please don't tell me that."" 
 ""Take a look."" 
 ""I can't."" 
 Before I could refuse again, Tracy shoved the phone in front of my face. It shook in my hands as I took it. 
 Sweet Jesus. 
 Why did I even look? 
 Lo and behold, Justin shows up to share the summer home with his girlfriend. Cheating is not a deal-breaker for me but not to worry, it doesn't happen here. Justin is in love with his girlfriend and in hate with Amelia. And he makes her life absolutely miserable. 
 ""Even though I was too stunned to say anything, my heart was screaming. I knew deep down my reaction wasn't just because of my physical attraction to him. It was because despite all of the changes, one thing had stayed exactly the same. His eyes. They reflected the same hurt that I remembered from the very last time I saw him."" 
 Justin and Amelia have THE most delicious love-hate relationship throughout much of the story until the real reason for his deep-seated hostility comes out. It is heartbreaking, emotional and very sad, but he and Amelia make an uneasy truce to continue to share the home that her grandmother left to both of them equally when she passed away. 
 ""Will you at least look at me when you're talking to me?"" He turned around and walked toward me slowly then leaned his face in. I could feel his words on my lips when he asked, ""Is this better? You'd rather me in your face like this?"" 
 I could practically taste his breath. My entire body felt weak from the close contact, so I backed away. 
 ""I didn't think so,"" he snarled. 
 There is SO much to this story that can't be given away for fear of major spoilers! But once again, Ms. Ward has crafted a richly-woven, very intense story, with beautifully damaged characters who might not ever find their way back together again. 
 Did I mention the heat factor is off the charts? Sexy, senstive musician anyone? 
 ""Hurt me?"" He let out a slight angry laugh then shocked me with what he said next. ""It changed me. I loved you, Amelia. I was in love with you."" Justin ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. ""How the fuck did you not know that?"" 
 Ah, these two. Living together under one roof becomes almost unbearable. The this book takes a major turn in the second half of the book which only makes Justin and Amelia's story all the more bittersweet. And the Epilogue!! GAHHH!!! Loved. RoomHate is one of my favorite Penelope Ward books and I already miss these characters!!

"Well, now, hello Tyler Bell!! Midnight Mass is a sensual, highly erotic and surprisingly emotional companion novella to Priest, one of my favorite books this year. The author has hit her stride with this sexy and sometimes painful but always steamy story of the first years of Tyler and Poppy's marriage. 
 ""Of all the ghosts that haunt me, it is the priest who stays the closest, who dogs my steps from dawn until dusk...It is the priest who tells me to be afraid being punished. 
 Like I'm not already afraid. 
 But I never expected my punishment to come so soon."" 
 Don't miss this book!! The bittersweet ending seals the author's reputation as a wonderful writer with depth and real emotion. Highly recommended!

"2.5 - 3 Stars 
 As much I loved CRAZY GOOD, the debut book from this author, I am not quite sure what to make of this latest book. CRAZY GOOD was a sexy, refreshing, very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author. Unfortunately, TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all. There is a dramatic, totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or set-up. Added to the large number of editing and grammar issues, I'm afraid this just wasn't for me. Perhaps some editing next time around will help. I will definitely give this author a try again but this whole book was just a giant puzzle to me.",11,3,1,123,48.44,1.87,48.3,94.59,17.57,13.01,89.43,72.36,56.1,11.38,5.69,5.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.69,14.63,7.32,2.44,12.2,8.13,9.76,4.88,2.44,13.01,11.38,7.32,2.44,0.81,1.63,0.0,13.01,0.81,12.2,0.81,0.81,0.81,4.07,1.63,4.07,0.0,8.94,6.5,0.81,5.69,3.25,0.81,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.07,4.07,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.69,0.81,0.0,4.88,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.69,4.88,0.0,1.63,3.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.25,6.5,3.25,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.45,6.5,5.69,0.0,0.0,1.63,1.63,0
"My first thoughts upon completing this book, ""MY HEART. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS SERIES IS OVER!! Another perfect heart-stopping story from Kristen Ashley."" 
 This series holds a very special place in my heart because KNIGHT was my very first Kristen Ashley book ever. I didn't quite fully understand the warning that came along with that book, because to me, KNIGHT was absolute perfection. After I then read almost every single book Ms. Ashley wrote, I realized that the Unfinished Heroes Series was a bit different from her other, mostly-nice, all swoony Alpha heroes. And I adore every single one of her ""unfinished"" heroes. 
 SEBRING was like unwrapping a special gift. Olivia was a complex heroine, damaged and scarred both indies and out, having grown up into a crime family. She trusts no one, and for good reason. Her own family is treacherous, immoral and very dangerous. But yet she cannot escape the life that has been mapped out for her. She is an obedient daughter, following the rules until the night she meets Nick Sebring. Olivia is closed off to the world and has given up all hopes for a normal life. 
 ""I'd learned that I didn't allow myself to show emotion. 
 Ever"" 
 I was always fascinated by Nick since he first appeared in KNIGHT. He has a fascinating back story here, investigating Olivia's family and targeting her in an effort to infiltrate the Shade family to take down her father. Nick's first love was caught up in their violent world and became victim of the Shade family's notorious brand of violence. 
 SEBRING is not a pretty, hearts and flowers, sweet love story. Its is gritty, raw, violent, yet amongst all of that, Kristen Ashley's trademark goodness and beauty and love shines through. Nick Sebring himself does not think he can be redeemed but something about Olivia sings to him. They make the perfect couple, really. They both love a certain brand of kink and tom me, are PERFECTLY matched. 
 There is plenty of heartbreak in this book. Olivia carries around secrets in her heart that would absolutely break another person. So it makes her coming together with Nick Sebring even more bittersweet and gorgeous. And Nick...well, I fell in love with him. Yes, the very same Nick Sebring from KNIGHT who caused so much trouble! SEBRING is everything I love about a Kristen Ashley book: family, incredibly hot sex scenes, fast-paced action, forgiveness and yes, love. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Happy reading!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 I love picking up a book, not having any expectations whatsoever, and then being totally swept away and entranced by the story!! That is what happened with THE BALLER. What I though would be a standard, predictable sports romance turned into a page-turner for me, with a sudden and very unexpected twist in the middle of the story! 
 Delilah is a successful sports journalist (another I love about Vi Keeeland's books - her heroines are all smart, feisty women) who is assigned to interview superstar football player Brody Easton. She has had a bit of a dry spell lately which might just be coming to an end with the entry of Brody into her life. 
 ""That man isn't into me. He wants in to me."" 
 ""Same thing."" 
 ""No. There's a major difference."" 
 Brody lays his cards out on the table pretty much from the beginning. From playing a locker room prank on Delilah, to pursuing her relentlessly, I absolutely loved watching their relationship develop. 
 But Brody has a major secret he is hiding. Will it destroy Delilah's trust, once she finally lets herself open up to Brody? 
 I read this book in almost one sitting, it was that enjoyable. I adore Brody, he is cocky yet funny, sexy yet very, very smart and intuitive and very much in tune with what women want. The story takes a surprising turn which I did NOT see coming and I literally could not tell where the author was going to take this story. The ending was very satisfying and I highly recommend THE BALLER!! You will love it.

"5 STUNNING STARS!! 
 MISSED CONNECTION had me at hello! Something about 40-something main characters gets me EVERY time. Put this fantastic, second-chance romance on your must-read list for 2016! When I finished this book, I was a sobbing mess and felt compelled to finish my bottle of wine...yes, it's THAT kind of emotional, yet very satisfying and ultimately uplifting kind of story, 
 I am a HUGE fan of Mara White but have never read anything by K. Larsen although JEZEBEL has been on my Kindle since its release. MISSED CONNECTION is not really typical of Mara White's other books and it just shows the breadth of her amazing writing talent. I can't tell you how thrilled I was to read a book with older characters, who have lived a life and who have a richness and a history to their stories. 
 The writing is perfection. It is stunning, with an easy flow and believable dialogue and settings. Ty and Jess have very realistic jobs, family issues and other ""adult"" issues in both their lives. If you've read the Synopsis, you know this book is based on a ""missed connection"" between these two years before and that they seek each other out via a Craigslist ad. 
 ""The ghost of this woman kept alive only by a matchbook, a tattoo and now, a post, just hanging out somewhere online."" 
 Please don't read anything more about this book; just grab a bottle of wine, find a comfortable spot and get ready to lose yourself in this story. It is heartfelt, passionate, funny at times, and yes, very, very sexy. Ty and Jess will not be forgotten and this book just goes to show you that there is always hope, there is always the chance of true love and a true connection and there is always the chance to take the path that is right for you. I took away from this book the powerful message to always follow your heart. This gem of a book should be on everyone's must-read list. You won't regret it. 
 ""I hope you know, that if I could, I would give you the stars. But instead, all I can give you is everything I have in my heart."" 
 Believe in true love. It's real and it can be life-changing. Thank you Mara White and K. Larsen for a gorgeous story, I loved every single word!

"4.5 STARS!! 
 ""Love is friendship set on fire. I get it now."" 
 AHHHHHH!!!! Smoking hot, sweet, SEXXXXY and emotional!! This book has it all!! Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy write some of the best new adult romance today and they hit it out of park again (or made a goal??) with US. I fell in love all over again with Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley. If you are looking to try a MM story, I highly recommend this series. It is pure romance! 
 Wes and Jamie are faced with the real-life pressures of a modern couple when Wes travels with his pro team and Jamie begins a job coaching. Added to the stress of their relationship is that fact that Wes is still hiding his relationship with Jamie. It pained me to suffer alongside both Wes and Jamie when they could not go public with their relationship. A sudden, devastating illness makes everything very clear to Wes and finally gives these two some of the normalcy that other couples enjoy. Leave it to these two authors to write an engaging, hot, funny and very sentimental story that shows the reader that love is for everyone. 
 I also adored Blake, who was funny and a true friend. Hello, he deserves his own book!! US is a wonderfully romantic and incredibly sexy story about two people in love. This book will have you cheering, laughing, clutching your heart and fanning yourself. What more can you ask for? Kudos to Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy for another beautiful story in this series.

"If you have about 45 minutes to spare and want a super-hot and dirty read, look no further. I was laughing at some of the over-the-top lines in this story while still loving every single minute!! Luke and Logan are H-O-T Alphas who also happen to be twins. They make no apologies for their menage lifestyle and to their credit, they do stay away from their stepsister until she is 24 years old.

"Griffin's story was a roller coaster ride of emotions and feeling! Untamed was a very surprising read and is most definitely NOT just a re-telling of the earlier books; Griffin has a VERY unique POV! 
 If you are a fan of the Thoughtless series, then you will love this book. Even if you haven't read all of the books in the series, you can still read and enjoy Untamed. Griffin is outrageous, sexxxxxy and so dirty, but above it all, he's actually hiding a heart of gold and a very sensitive personality. He just wants to be taken seriously by the band, something they refuse to do; they can only see his outrageous behavior. 
 ""I don't know how much longer I can wait, Anna. They're holding me underwater and I'm drowning. Something's gotta change. And soon."" 
 I absolutely loved his scenes with Anna! The women in this series have always been my favorite. Griffin and Anna's relationship is center stage here and it is really beautiful. Their scenes together are super-steamy, passionate, and literally jump right off the page. Untamed started off slowly for me, but once I started, I couldn't put this book down. The characters felt like coming home to me, and Griffin's ultimate redemption is worth every single step of his sometimes-painful journey. 
 When we were spent, she sagged against me. 
 ""You're so hot when you come,"" she murmured against my skin. I ran my hand up and down her back. 
 ""I know."" And I did. I'd filmed myself jacking off once, just to see what I looked like, and I had to say, it was pretty amazing. Anna was one lucky woman. 
 If you are a fan of rock-star romance, Untamed is the book for you. And it is a definite must-read for all fans of the Thoughtless series!",7,4,1,303,15.35,34.42,50.23,39.45,12.12,18.48,87.13,74.59,61.06,16.83,13.53,6.6,0.33,2.64,2.64,1.32,3.3,13.2,6.27,1.32,9.9,11.22,8.58,8.25,1.32,18.81,6.27,4.95,1.65,1.32,0.0,0.33,12.21,1.65,10.56,1.65,0.66,1.98,1.98,1.98,3.3,0.0,5.28,2.64,1.32,1.65,0.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,10.23,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.66,0.66,7.92,0.0,0.0,1.65,1.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.97,0.33,0.33,1.65,0.66,0.0,1.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.33,0.99,0.33,0.33,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,5.61,9.57,0.33,2.64,4.29,1.32,0.33,1.32,4.29,5.94,6.6,1.32,0.99,0.66,0.33,0.0,0.0,22.44,6.93,5.94,0.0,1.32,3.96,4.29,0
"Okay, I can add motocross racing to my list of favorite sports now! While WHIPPED can be read as a standalone, it follows the story of Reid's best friend Brett, and Nora's sister Georgia, who were introduced in the first book. 
 WHIPPED is another sweet and sexy, fairly light romance between Brett, who was injured in an unfortunate bike accident, and Georgia, Nora's sister. Georgia has been traumatized by the tragic and sudden loss of her fiance several years before and it has affected every relationship she has. Brett is sexy, a little cocky, funny and surprises himself by falling in love with the emotionally unavailable Georgia. 
 I love all the easy banter between the guys in this book and the author's entertaining style of writing. There is no high drama in this book, not a ton of angst, just a sexy and action-packed romance set against the world of competitive motocross racing. I could almost feel the wind in my hair when the author describes the racing scenes! And I also love the small-town setting, with the families who know everyone and the warm feeling of community. If you are looking for a hot, quick, exciting and very sweet romance, then I highly recommend this series by Elizabeth Lee. The next book is about another couple in the motocross racing world and I can't wait!

"The Shadow is a lush, passionate and complex story, filled with romance, art, history and suspense. I am not a huge fan of paranormal stories but I make an exception for Sylvain Reynard's books. I LOVE the Gabriel's Redemption series and Professor Gabriel Emerson makes an appearance here. What more could you ask for? 
 William and Raven are reunited in this story but William is battling forces who are trying to sabotage him. He has finally found the love of his life and he wants nothing more than to worship Raven forever. 
 ""I will never have your nobility of spirit, or your protective nature, but as long as I have your love, I can be content."" 
 William will stop at nothing to protect Raven from both other vampires and from those who scheme to drive them apart. There is lots of action and mystery, written in the style that is completely unique to Sylvain Reynard. This is a very sensual and passionate book, and even if you do not usually read paranormal romance, you will love this story. The streets of Florence seem to come alive! 
 We also learn about William's early life and the tragic story of how he lost his first love. Raven is completely trusting of him and along with the intrigue, there is also a little humor here, too. 
 ""You're giving me a toothache."" 
 He pulled back. ""How is that possible?"" 
 She laughed. ""It's a figure of speech. It means you're being too sweet. Say something awful."" 
 William's expression changed and he brought his lips to her ear. ""I want to take you back to the house, so I can spread you on my bed and do all kinds of wicked things to you."" 
 I can't wait to see what happens next! The Shadow is a beautifully written book and my favorite in the Florentine Series so far. Lush, lyrical, passionate and very intense. The outtakes are absolutely fantastic. Don't miss it!!

"""Charli Moore I like you.I have since the first time I saw you."" 
 I am a hug fan of Aleatha Romig. Her Consequences series is an absolute favorite of mine and is one of those series that you can't stop talking about non-stop with anyone who'll listen to your ranting and raving about Tony Rawlings. 
 I couldn't wait to read BETRAYAL, the first in a series of 5 full-length novels in the Infidelity series. Now, while cheating does not bother me in the least, for those of you who might shy away from such books, rest assured that's NOT what this book is about. At all. Alexandria has grown up very wealthy, and has tried to break free from her extremely dysfunctional family by attending college as far away as possible from her controlling family and wicked stepfather. 
 After gradating from college, she yearns to ""cut loose"" and does just that during one week at a resort with her best friend. She meets a mysterious, sexy, uber-Alpha named Nox and they embark on a passionate and intense, no-strings-attached week. She uses the name Charli so that she can remain completely anonymous. But they will have just one week together, even though she clearly develops intense feelings for the stunning Nox. 
 ""Our first time will be what you want, what you fantasize about. I'm going to take you, right here, right now."" 
 WOW!! Their scenes together are richly written and breathtaking and they have tons of chemistry. I absolutely loved the alternating timeframes which added to overall feeling of tension and foreboding. There is a completely surprising twist at the end, and if you have a few hours, then prepare to become completely captivated by the sexy Nox and smart, beautiful Alex. Her family drama back home in Savannah, Georgia was a little over-the-top for me but does serve to show how far she has come to break away from her controlling family. 
 This book really brings the story together at the end and it definitely ends on a cliffhanger! I can't wait to see what happens next for Alex and Nox!!",8,4,1,352,47.67,74.13,13.06,55.62,17.6,18.18,88.64,73.3,57.67,15.34,11.08,3.13,0.28,2.56,3.41,1.14,4.26,13.64,5.97,1.99,15.06,7.95,6.53,7.1,1.42,14.49,8.24,5.68,3.13,1.99,0.28,0.85,11.08,0.28,10.8,0.85,1.7,1.7,1.42,2.56,2.56,0.0,5.97,3.69,1.42,1.42,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.49,4.26,0.0,0.0,0.85,1.14,1.14,10.23,0.28,0.57,3.41,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.56,0.57,0.28,1.42,0.28,0.0,0.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.85,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.57,6.82,7.95,1.14,0.85,4.26,0.85,0.28,1.14,5.4,1.99,6.53,2.27,0.57,0.0,0.28,0.0,0.28,16.76,5.11,4.83,0.0,1.42,1.7,3.69,0
"4.5 STARS 
 Crashed Out is exactly why I LOVE Tessa Bailey's books! It's lusty, funny and filled with lots of real emotion and heart. And an older woman/younger man theme? YES, PLEASE!! 
 I SWOONED over Sarge. He left town years before as a shy, introverted teenager and has now returned to town a rock star. He has come back to visit his sister and her child and take a break from the pressures of band life. But even though he is now famous, he has never forgotten his older sister's best friend, Jasmine. He has been in love with her since he was young, but she never paid much attention to him. But now...well, let's just say things have changed a LOT since Jasmine last laid eyes on Sarge!! 
 ""But television-size and life-size were two very different things, apparently, because Sarge had been remodeled from a one-story colonial into a big brick mansion."" 
 Jasmine resists Sarge's attention but he pursues her relentlessly (thank God). He is sexy...intense...sensitive...just totally irresistible. Much of the fun of reading a Tessa Bailey book is the trademark dirty talk and boy, does she deliver here. My word. Sarge is EVERYTHING!! And he writes music!! As for Jasmine, I absolutely adored the fact that she was quite a few years older than Sarge and was filled with insecurities. Why would Sarge be interested in her? After all, he could have anyone he wanted. But he has never forgotten the girl he left behind, and he is bound and determined to make her forget their age difference: 
 ""No more fixing me sandwiches. No more ruffling my goddamn hair."" He reached down and grasped her hand, bringing it to the back of his head, moving it in a messy circle. ""If I ever feel your fingers in my hair again, they'd better be pulling my face closer to whatever I'm licking."" 
 I also loved how Sarge encouraged Jasmine to pursue her dreams, and as with all of Ms. Bailey's stories, family plays an important role here. Crashed Out has turned out to be one of my favorite books by Tessa Bailey. I cannot wait for more stories in this series. I highly recommend Crashed Out if you love an uber-sexy, steamy story with plenty of heart!!

"What a fabulous, escapist story!! 
 Nelle's writing keeps getting better and better and this is by far my favorite of all of her books. I literally read this in one day and became very invested in these characters and their lives. 
 Brandon Taylor is a Hollywood superstar, the star of a hit TV show and engaged to a beautiful woman. The problem is, he has amnesia from a near-fatal hit-and-run and cannot recall those closest to him, or the details of his life just before the accident. He feels no connection to his fiancee Katrina nor does he particularly like his business manager. Things just don't quite fit. But he does very much like his personal assistant Zoey, who constantly fantasizes about her boss. 
 Apparently Mr. Taylor was somewhat of a jerk before the accident. Now, he actually says ""please"" and ""thank you"" and finds himself thinking about curvy Zoey all the time. Unforgettable is the kind of story that has you cheering for the underdog, booing the villains and basically ripping through the pages to find out what happens next. This book is filled with lots of glamour and glitz, and I loved that many familiar Los Angeles settings and landmarks are mentioned in this book. 
 Nelle writes a male POV like nobody's business and I loved Brandon's chapters!! Zoey is adorable and very real. This book does end on a cliffhanger but the next books will be out soon. Unforgettable is a great Hollywood-themed read, with lots of humor and romance and sexy times. Can't wait for what happens next!!

"Total surprise here!! Loved HARD TO BREAK!! I am a huge fan of Bella Jewel but I had not read any of her more recent books. When an ARC of Hard to Break landing on my Kindle, I did not know anything about the story and dove right in. I was completely taken by surprise but this sexy, funny. fast-paced story that had a gorgeous, Alpha and a strong and feisty heroine! And, she's a mechanic! 
 There are plenty of contemporary romances out there and this story stands out. Quinn is about to lose her family's mechanic shop because of her alcoholic father who can't hold it together. But she won't give up, and when she and Tazen first meet, sparks fly. Yes, he's swoony but Quinn won't just cave in and give in to him, she can dish it out like one of the guys. 
 Spend an afternoon or evening with Quinn and Tazen and you won't go wrong! There's plenty of steam here and plenty of humor, too. Bella Jewel does not take herself or her characters too seriously and there's plenty of witty dialogue. I must admit I have never read a book where the heroine is a mechanic and I totally enjoyed it. Hard to Break is part of a series but it can be read on its own. Sexy, thrilling and funny, this is one enjoyable read.

 Jane Harvey-Berrick delivers another beautiful, sexy story. Her books have a depth and connection between the characters that I love. 
 I absolutely adore an older woman-younger man story. I was worried that I would be lost, having not read The Education of Sebastian and The Education of Caroline first. These books have been on my Kindle since they were released and now I am dying to read them. I followed this story with no problem at all, and fell in love with Sebastian and Caroline. 
 Years before, Sebastian and Caroline had a passionate and forbidden affair. He was just a teenager and she was married. They were torn apart but he never got over her. He has spent years trying to forget her and Caroline has not been able to forget him either. The depth of their love for each other is evident in this book and in Sebastian's stubbornness in trying to break through Caroline's emotional barriers. 
 He has now a Marine stationed in Switzerland in a safe but boring desk job. Caroline is now a journalist, waiting for approval to travel to Afghanistan. Sebastian jumps at the chance to spend time with Caro but his years of wild drinking and partying plus his temper put barriers between them. 
 It was so clear to me that these two belong together! The European setting is wildly romantic and the scenes between Caroline and Sebastian are wonderfully erotic and steamy. If you love a second chance love story, then Semper Fi is a must-read. Jane Harvey-Berrick is an author whose books I will automatically read. She never disappoints with her beautiful, sexy writing and deeply-felt characters. As an added bonus, proceeds from this book go towards military charities. And now, I can't wait to dive in to The Education of Caroline and The Education of Sebastian!

 I loved this book!! I am obsessed with Zaal Kostava. This is a really dark but VERY sexy and enjoyable story. Reap is filled with passion, emotion and heat. It is most definitely my favorite Tillie Cole book. The horribly scarred and damaged Zaal absolutely broke my heart. But his beauty and soul shine through when he finds kindness and yes, even love, after many tortuous twists and turns. Although this should read after Raze, it is a stunning story and I highly recommend both books. Talia is a fantastic heroine, strong, beautiful and compassionate. Loving Zaal might come with dire consequences, but she cannot be without him. 
 ""You are my Zaal, the man whose soul has stolen mine."" 
 There are terribly violent and dark themes in this book but I loved it and could not put it down!

"4.5 Thrilling Stars!! 
 WOW!! Spellbinding, engrossing and sensual, Madame X is a richly detailed story that is filled with mystery and suspense. Very adult and incredibly sexy, this story completely took me by surprise and I can't recommend it highly enough! 
 The blurb to this book is really just a small part of this story, and it is interesting that none of the main characters are mentioned by name in the synopsis. I had not read any reviews on this one going in so I am going to keep this short. If you are looking for a very adult, very sensual read, then Madame X is for you. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book and I absolutely fell in love with the male protagonists (yes, plural) and cannot WAIT for the next book! 
 ""Your sexuality belongs to me, X. No one else may even so much as fucking smell you, do you understand me? You. Are. Mine."" 
 There is a touch of BDSM in this book but I believe that more will be revealed on that front in the next story. There are themes of dominance and control here but I was thrown off guard several times by the direction that this story took. 
 We are introduced to both Caleb and Logan in this story and while one might seem cruel, controlling and calculating, I do not believe that all is at seems and that Logan, who we meet later in the story, will also have many, many layers to him. I don't think there are any real villains or heroes in this book (I think?! I could be very wrong!) and that is the genius of this story. 
 Sexy, explicit, fast-paced and very, very creative, Madame X thrilled me on many levels. I couldn't put it down!

 WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! 
 This book picks up from the end of Book 1, and explores Weston pursuing Mirella. Please note that this is the second book in a trilogy and most definitely ends with an incredible cliffhanger! I found this book to be incredibly gripping, dealing with a taboo subject in an erotic, almost romantic way. 
 Ms. Roya's writing is charming and playful at times and almost addictive. I was absolutely fascinated by Weston and Gabe and was kept on the edge of my seat waiting for their marriages and their relationships to crash and burn. 
 ""We didn't learn from our mistakes. We just made them all over again."" 
 I found myself thinking about these characters even when I wasn't reading, which to me, is the sign of a good book. Mirella and Weston go back to their arrangement but Mirella lays down the new rule: their relationship is to be only physical, with no emotional attachment. Weston falling in love with her is what got them into trouble the first time around. 
 ""I shouldn't have let this all this get so out of control."" 
 This book is still told only from Mirella's POV but it delves more into describing Gabe and Weston's feelings. Bridget, however, is still very much a mystery. I would love to know more about her. In Book 2, the two couples try to have a ""normal"" relationship, which does require a suspended sense of reality, but I loved the way Ms. Roya explored the boundaries of their relationships. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here, either by Gabe ending the open marriage arrangement or by Weston falling in love with Mirella all over again. I was not disappointed! This is an incredibly addictive story, and I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy. I am dying to read more about Gabe and Weston, two very passionate, sexy characters who each deserve their own book!

 Ms. Manwhore is a frothy, romantic and sexy finale to the Manwhore series. This novella is almost like an Epilogue to the series and wraps up Rachel and Saint's love story with a big, beautiful bow. Saint whisks Rachel off to the wedding and honeymoon of her dreams, with lots of big romantic gestures and ultimately lots of sexy times despite their agreement to abstain from sex for a bit. Fans of this series and of Katy Evans will absolutely love the swoony passion and exotic settings in Ms. Manwhore. There's no angst in this story so enjoy the happily ever after!

"JESSE'S DINER is another sweetly sexy, romantic and swoon-y story from one of my favorite authors! Cardeno C. is my go-to author when I want a feel-good, sweet but very sexy romance. Jesse's Diner fits the bill and although it is a novella in the Hope series, you don't need to have read book #1 first to become involved in the story of Steve and Tanner. 
 Steve has become a widower at the ripe ""old"" age of 39 (although for me, that is young!) He and his partner had adopted Mike, whose best friend Tanner runs a diner in town. 
 Tanner has always had a crush on the older Steve, but never acted on it. Now that Steve is single, Tanner is afraid to make a move. For one, he is a virgin, and the other reason being that Steve is still in mourning for his partner Jesse. Tanner is also extremely shy and has no idea how to go about flirting or showing his interest in Steve. 
 There is a bit of tension in this book with a reveal that comes early on in the book. It is dealt with sensitively and with care by the author. 
 The humor in this book comes from Tanner's innocence and huge crush on Steve, who obviously has tons more experience sexually than Tanner, but Steve has never really dated either. This story is just a sexy, romantic story with a happy ending, just like all of CC's books. This novella will give you a few hours of pure pleasure and escapism, and isn't that what reading romance is all about? Another definite recommend from me for this sweet, passionate novella!

"Whoa!! This is definitely one of the dirtiest, most explicit little stories I've ever read!! And I competely and totally enjoyed every minute of this fast, filthy story. Read through to the end, there's a nice little twist. Alexa Riley's short stories are perfect for a fresh break between longer books. For fans of very adult, explicit erotica only!!

"4.5 Passionate Stars!! 
 MAJOR heartache. MAJOR passion. And a strong heroine with a painful past! I'm obsessed with Scarlett and Dante!! 
 ""Love is War"" is a great description of this second chance, lovers-to-enemies story. BREAKING HIM was nothing that I expected. I need the second book yesterday! I must know more about Scarlett and Dante!! 
 This story has very much of a Tristan-and-Danika feel to it. The chemistry between Scarlett and Dante is almost so real, you can feel it leap off the pages. Why is Scarlett so ANGRY about everything? At first, her prickly attitude kept me at a distance, but once I learned more about her character and her background, I absolutely fell in love with her and was rooting for her. And Dante, well he seems like the perfect guy at first and I just know that he will end up doing the right thing. He and Scarlett MUST be together! They are meant for each other!! Do you hear me, Author Lady?! 
 The secondary characters are all fantastic, and are an integral part of the story. Ms. Lilley does a great job of describing the social hierarchy of small town life and how stifling it can be for those who do not ""fit in"". I literally read this book in one sitting and cannot wait for the continuation of Scarlett and Dante's story. Ms. Lilley has once again created an absolutely unforgettable couple whose passion and chemistry burned through every page.

"4.5 Sexy, Gritty Stars!! 
 Karina Halle never ceases to amaze with her writing! She can take a reader from swoony, sexy contemporary romance, to stories like Dirty Promises, a brutal, rough, gritty and violent story that is incredibly gripping, sexy and readable. 
 Javier Bernal is a cruel man. Yet I still felt sympathy for him (it's true!) because if you have taken the journey with this character, you will know he is the product of his history and background. But make no mistake, this book is violent and is set in the world of drug cartels. If you are looking for a different read, with fantastic writing, then I highly recommend this series. 
 Javier and Luisa have a marriage that is on the brink of falling apart. Their story here is an incredibly wild ride and is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to take a risk with your reading, then you will be immensely rewarded. I did not know what to expect with DIRTY PROMISES because I knew this would be a gritty story, maybe even more so than the other books in this series. Karina Halle really delivers the goods with this book and if you are a fan of dark, action-packed stories with a very damaged ""hero"", then please read this series. The books and the characters are unforgettable!!

"absolutely fell in love with Frisco and he might be my favorite character from this author!! (I MIGHT love City more, I can't decide!) I also loved this book even more than the first book in this series. Frisco has had his heart broken and he is stubbornly refusing to get involved with another woman, that is, until he meets Georgia. 
 These two could not be more opposite, she is much younger than Frisco, bookish, inexperienced, but very sweet and VERY beautiful. Frisco knows he should stay away but he is insanely attracted to her. 
 ""I had a huge problem. She could be my worst nightmare and my biggest regret."" 
 Chelle Bliss always infuses her books with a strong sense of friendship and family. I love that about her books because all of her characters seem very grounded and this book is no different. I feel in love with Frisco and with Georgia and was rooting for them to be together. And a male POV...Chelle Bliss writes some of THE best male POV's around!! Frisco is a dirty-talking Alpha who knows what he wants and protects what's his. 
 If you loved the Gallo family books, you will adore this Unlawful Desire. This book has the same strong characters, fast-paced story line without unnecessary angst and tons of steamy, sexy scenes. Chelle Bliss' writing keeps getting better and better and I can't wait to read her next book!!

"4.5 - 5 Thrilling Stars!! 
 HARD BEAT is an exciting and sensual story, set among the suspenseful world of foreign jounalists. Tanner and Beaux's rocky story is sure to please fans of K. Bromberg and marks an impressive launch into romantic suspense!!I loved this very adult, very sexy story. 
 Ms. Bromberg has a very special place in my heart and I treasure each and every word she writes. Her characters feel very real to me, I connect with them and that emotional connection makes the difference between a good book and a great book. HARD BEAT is another unforgettable entry in the Driven world, but it can absolutely be read as a standalone book in case you have not had the pleasure of reading the earlier books. 
 I loved Tanner from his brief appearance as Rylee's brother in the earlier books. He intrigued me, no doubt, so I was beyond thrilled when I heard he was getting his own book! And he is every bit the Alpha hero that I knew he would be! And Beaux...sexy. brilliant, ambitious...I expect nothing less from perfection in a K. Bromberg heroine and the author does not disappoint. The chemistry between the main characters was palpable, and their scenes together, perfection. 
 ""She's my little piece of Heaven in this land full of Hell."" 
 This book is filled with twists, turns, romance, heart-stopping action, and a story that could be literally lifted from current events. Tanner and Beaux are everything I come to expect from Ms. Bromberg's characters. Without a doubt, HARD BEAT cements Ms. Bromberg's rightfully-deserved best-selling status and I cannot wait for what she has in store next.

"4.5 - 5 Heart-Stopping Stars 
 This book is why I read contemporary romance. The swoony hero, the beautiful, sweet heroine who is hiding a tragic secret, the explosive passion, but most of all, the deep and emotional connection I felt for Adam and Evie all added up to a perfect page-turner that kept me up all night. 
 Adam!! My heart broke for him and for the love he lost with Evie. Adam and Evie (LOVE the names!) fell in love when they were just teenagers. Adam did not trust many people so when Evie suddenly disappeared, he became even more bitter than he was before. He spends years searching for her and when he finally finds her, his feelings are a mix of rage and heartbreak over their lost years. Evie refuses to tell him why she disappeared suddenly all those years before, so their reunion is bittersweet, filled with longing and regret, but also undeniable and explosive passion. 
 WHEN I WAS YOURS is told through a series of flashbacks which put me through every single emotion possible. The story, set against the backdrop off Hollywood and the mega-rich, is more than just a classic rich boy meets poor girl love story. It's sexy, heartfelt, and heartbreaking all at once. The unexpected twist had my heart in my throat and had me silently cheering for our MC's to get their happily ever after. 
 ""You cut your hair."" 
 ""It has been ten years."" 
 ""I know. I just...I remember a time when you said you'd never cut your hair."" A small smile touches my lips at the memory. 
 ""Yeah, and I remember when you promised to love me till death do us part. Shit changes."" 
 My smile drops from my face. My cheeks sting like he's just slapped me. 
 I deserved that. Doesn't stop it from hurting like a bitch though. 
 Samantha Towle is one of my favorite writers and she absolutely delivered the goods with this story. The characters and their sweet, sexy and passionate love story won't soon be forgotten. Ever since I saw this stunning cover, I knew I just had to read this book! I absolutely adored Adam and Evie's story! Don't miss it.

"Complicate Me is for fans of Abbi Glines and her brand of Southern romance. Lucas and Alex have been best friends their whole lives. Excerpt that Alex's heart belongs to Lucas. She has always been in love with him. We are told over and over that they cannot be together but I didn't really buy the reason why. Alex was the younger kid sister of Lucas' best friend but then she grew up. There is lots of angst in this book mainly arising out of the two main characters not being together, when they clearly are meant for each other. I enjoyed the Southern setting, but didn't really buy into why these two couldn't be together.

"3.5 Stars 
 I have really loved reading sports romances lately and I have never read a gymnastics story so I was eager to read this book by Laurel Ulen Curtis. Nik and Callie's story is a fascinating look into the world of competitive gymnastics, and is a very fast-paced, different story. The pressure that the athletes put on themselves and the peer pressure is incredible, and the author does a great job at writing about this world. 
 ""I'm just wearing my bruises on the outside."" 
 Callie is both strong and competitive, as well as vulnerable. I really liked her character. I absolutely loved how the author ended each chapter in a way that flowed right into the next. This unusual formula worked very well here and I must say I have never read a book that was written in this way. I also love alternative POV's and Ms. Curtis accomplished that perfectly in this book. Nik and Callie's thoughts flowed into each other from one chapter to the next, and it kept me turning the pages until the very end! 
 ""I was telling it...As us."" 
 If you a fan of sports romance, then you will love this book. You don't have to know anything about the sport of gymnastics to enjoy this story. The author does a great job of explaining the moves and the environment of the sport. There is plenty of romance in this book, too, along with some drama that resolves itself very nicely.

"Small-town life? Check. Motocross racing? Check. Second-chance romance? Check! LOVED all of the sweet elements of this sweet and sexy and heart-pounding romance from Elizabeth Lee! THROTTLED is a throughly entertaining, exciting and refreshing romance with all of the hot and sexy elements you would expect from a book that features motocross racing. 
 Reid and Nora were high school sweethearts until he suddenly left her and their small town to chase his dreams of becoming a world-class motocross racer. She has tried to move on with a new boyfriend, but no one has ever compared to Reid. 
 ""To be young and in love again. No worries. No responsibilities. I twas just me and him, and his bike, of course. The bike was always there. I should have known he'd pick it over me one day."" 
 Oh, Reid! How could you? Nora is sweet, beautiful and kind. I absolutely loved how Reid pursued Nora once he realized his first love felt the same way about him. If you have never read a motocross racing book, I highly recommend this light, fast-paced, feel-good story. And the steam factor is plenty hot, plus there are some very funny, laugh-out-loud moments in THROTTLED. 
 ""Reid was the reason I could never see a future with anyone else. He was my future."" 
 Awwww!!! Happy reading!

"*LUCKY by J.M. DARHOWER* 
 There's nothing by J.M. Darhower that I won't read. And I aboslutely loved this short story. 
 This story is a prequel to an upvoming new book called 'Twenty to Life' is now on my must-read list. 
 Maddalena is the only daughter of a mob boss, and she is about to enter into an arranged marriage. She decides to throw caution to the wind and spend her last night of freedom with a sexy, mysterious stranger she meets in a bar, far from her NYC neighborhood. ""Lucky"" is sexy, broody and the perfect candidate for a one-night stand with no strings attached. They don' even know each other's names. 
 There is a huge twist at the end and it is a credit to Ms. Darhower's writing that she packs more chemistry, intelligent dialogue and creative plot into this short story than most novels that I have read. Don't miss this!

"4.5 Romantic and Emotional Stars 
 I am a huge fan of Poughkeepsie and absolutely adored seeing the boys as young men in high school. They each suffered savage mental and physical abuse at the hands of their foster families. Their protectiveness shone through especially with the younger foster children, and with each other. They were forced to protect each other and have each other's backs at all times. 
 ""Never Alone."" 
 But this story is not all about fighting and surviving. There's a gorgeous and sweet and verrrrrry sexy romance between bad-boy Beckett and sweet Candy from the good side of town. They truly love each other and their time together provides some sweet comic relief. If you loved Poughkeepsie, you will love this book. I felt bonded toward the brothers and was heartbroken over their mistreatment. Beckett is really a good kid who never had a break in life and really never had much of a choice to turn out the way he did I wish he would have had more time with sweet Candy Cox, their scenes together were perfect, filled with yearning, sweetness, sexiness and lust. And romance, This book is a standalone but it will only whet your appetite for Poughkeepsie, which is one of my all-time favorite books.

"How do you describe the feeling that you get when you read a Kristen Ashley book? It is very hard to describe the emotions in simple words. Gut-wrenching? Heart-pounding? All of those happen to me and when a book is the end of a beloved series, well, let's just say that I was a sobbing mess while reading this Epilogue. 
 I binge read The 'Burg Series several years ago while on a long vacation that involved a lot of driving. Needless to say, I volunteered to sit in the back seat while on most of this vacation so I could read this fantastic series! As with all of her books, each of Ms. Ashley's series are slightly different; in the 'Burg, the characters are all a little older, a lot jaded, fiercely protective, and above all, unforgettable. 
 HOLD ON is a spectacular end to the series. Cher appeared earlier in the series, a hard-luck woman who struggles to keep her head above water and lives paycheck-to-paycheck to support herself and her beloved son. She never, ever believes that love will happen for her, and never, ever believes that she will find happiness with a man who will love and cherish her and her son. Cher broke my heart over and over, and I cried many times throughout this book at her sadness and despair. 
 ""But he'd never give me what I wanted. 
 I forgot. 
 I forgot that I wasn't the kind of girl who got what she wanted. 
 Not once. 
 Not in my whole f*g life. 
 Yeah, I'd forgotten that."" 
 Cher has a major case of unrequited love for Garrett (Merry), who in turn cannot forget the ex-wife who broke his heart. Sounds like a real downer of a book, right? But no! HOLD ON is a tale of mended hearts, beautiful possibilities and bright futures that everyone dreams about in their heart of hearts. There is no one who can infuse a story with magnificence and hope like Ms. Ashley. And HOLD ON is the perfect story of love and redemption, of fighting for what you want, and for holding on when you know you have goodness within your grasp. 
 The ending of this book very much reminded me of the series finale of one of my favorite TV shows, Six Feet Under. Kristen Ashley is the Queen of epilogues and I will never, ever forget this one. I am so sad to say goodbye to the families of the 'Burg but I know that Ms. Ashley has even more goodness in store for her readers. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

"Adorably sexy and very funny! This book is another fresh, modern, sexy and hilarious story from R.S. Grey. 
 The Allure of Dean Harper follows the story of Dean and Lily, the best friends of Julian and Jo from The Allure of Julian Lefray. Lily has just arrived in New York City and is opinionated, talented and very, very funny. She and Dean do not meet under the best of circumstances. Dean, a control freak and workaholic, arrives back from a business trip and his first meeting with his new bartender does not go well. The extremely talented Lily has been hired as a temporary bartender, and although she is incredible at her job, she immediately clashes with Dean and is actually fired right then and there. 
 From there, this funny enemies-to-lovers takes off into a fast-paced, behind-the-scenes peek into the competitive world of the restaurant business. Lily and Dean clearly are attracted to each other but they both bring out the worst in each other. Lily is outspoken and knowledgeable and I loved that she wouldn't back down from her opinions. Dean is driven, stubborn and very difficult. Their banter is witty and this story is the kind of book that R.S. Grey writes best. The scenes where Lily tries to adapt to life in the city are priceless. 
 This is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud, classic enemies-to-lovers story. If you are looking for a modern, funny and light read, with a HEA, then you will love The Allure of Dean Harper!

"I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didn't quite do it for me. I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic. I still would love to read the other books by this author, because their story lines sound very intriguing. Giving credit here for a very strong, kick-ass heroine, and a surprising ending.

"THREE LITTLE MISTAKES is an absolutely perfect erotic romance. It is pure escapism, pure lust and just plain hot. Have a cold shower ready, ladies, you will need one after reading this one. 
 Although this is the third book in a series, it is a complete standalone. The author does an amazing job of giving just the right amount of background on the Blindfold Club and on the characters in this book. The story is fantastic and the sex scenes...well, they are absolutely scorching. There is a threesome (almost a foursome, kind of a two + two-some) that rivals anything I've ever read. And I do love a good menage scene or three! 
 Em is the classic ""good girl"": she's smart, follows the rules but is wealthy in her own right. Joseph is the owner of the ""Blindfold Club"", an elite place where the woman have sex with their clients while blindfolded. High-end prostitutes but Em doesn't know this side of Joseph's business. She just thinks he is a wealthy club owner who has a very, very kinky side, and she wants to be very, very bad. 
 ""Being wrong and bad was just as I'd hoped it would be. It was so, so good."" 
 Joseph is a Dom and is several years older than Em. He is insanely attracted to her innocence and youth and they begin an affair where he will teach her how to be a submissive. Em is completely different from the other women Joseph has been with and he quickly becomes addicted to her, despite there being a million reasons why they shouldn't be together. 
 Now this might seem like a tired old trope, wealthy, older, worldly guy pursues a young, inexperienced girl, but this book is SO much more!! I was addicted from the the first page. This book has humor, witty dialogue, a great story and THE most amazing, prolonged sex scenes EVER. 
 Of course things grow complicated and there are many secrets between these two. Em might be a threat to Joseph's business, so will he be willing to give that up? They both push each other's boundaries and the conclusion was perfect. This book is a very explicit, very adult story that kept me riveted from beginning to end. It is a page-turner all the way! I loved it and can't wait to read the other books in this series!

"4 - 4.5 Stars!! 
 Two words: Knox Masters! I really enjoyed this book, Jen Frederick is one of my favorite New Adult writers. Sexy and very engaging, Sacked is a fast-paced, refreshingly funny story. 
 Jen Frederick's writing is like a breath of fresh air. This story is refreshing and verrra sexy while also sweet and funny at the same time. I LOVED it! Knox Masters is a college football superstar and Ellie is a transfer student who just might be his perfect match. She's smart, athletic, understands the game of football...but wait, she's hiding a secret that could jeopardize both their futures. And well, Knox is a virgin so there's that, too. 
 I often find that New Adult books don't hold enough romance or sexy times for me but SACKED has all of that PLUS MORE. It's a steamy, well-written story and it provides very knowing glimpses into the world of American college football. Plus I absolutely LOVED the witty back-and-forth between Knox and Ellie! And the fact that Knox is a virgin, well, I am usually a Doubting Thomas but this storyline just works. When he and Ellie finally get together, the slow-burn build up is totally worth it and the scenes between these two are off the charts hot!! 
 SACKED is a sexy, light, fast-paced read, and it is not just for fans of sports romance. There's plenty of humor and a little bit of drama and it all adds up to a terrific read. Knox Masters could not possibly be any hotter and I'm really looking forward to more books about the supporting characters. I loved SACKED and highly recommend it!!

"I am a huge fan of this author's writing! Liquid & Ash is more adult than her earlier books and I loved every emotional moment. Penelope is at a bad place in her life, having found out that her husband has not been honest with her, and feeling emotionally and financially stranded. She is afraid of ending up exactly where her mother did, abandoned and alone. Penny had given up everything to be with her husband and now she is basically adrift. 
 Her marriage is not what she thought it was. Penny feels as though drugs are her only relief from the stress of her life. She knows she is wasting her talents but she feels trapped. Then she meets sexy bartender/model Brandon and WOW!! These two have fantastic chemistry but Penny is more shut down than ever. How can she trust another man? 
 ""He possessed me,and I knew it was dangerous,but I just didn't care"". 
 Brandon has not had it easy and he. too, is untrusting. What I love about this author's books is that they are about ordinary people, who have real lives and real jobs and real struggles. It is a very refreshing change of pace. Penny and Brandon both struggle with their emotional baggage but Penny really puts her heart on the line and is finally completely honest with Brandon. There's a lot of drama here with the side characters and all in all, Liquid & Ash is a very fast-paced, very enjoyable story with very engaging characters and just the right amount of angst thrown in. 
 This is a wonderful story about realizing your full potential and living up to it. It is not always an easy read but E.M Abel is a very talented writer who ultimately delivers a very hopeful and optimistic story. Enjoy!

"""Tell me what happened nine years ago, when you left to go back home and forget all about Barcelona. And me."" 
 SIGH! A smart, modern, contemporary romance that was pure pleasure from beginning to end! Avery is newly arrived in Rome, reeling from a disastrous marriage where she's actually felt stifled and trapped for some time. Avery reconnects in Rome with an old friend AND with an old flame. Her boyfriend from a summer abroad in Europe is also in Rome. Marcelo has never forgotten Avery, and and has always wondered why she left Europe that summer so suddenly so many years before. 
 Avery has always played by others' rules: she married because it was the right thing to do, led a certain life because it was emptied of her, but here in Rome, with her friend Daisy, she is really free for the first time in her life to be her own woman. And Marcello still finds her beautiful and sexy and talented and they begin a gorgeous romance set against the stunning beauty of Italy. 
 ""For the first time in a very long time, I felt treasured."" 
 Fans of second-chance romance will devour this love story and revel in the stunning European settings! And who could resist falling in love against the incredibly exciting backdrop of Rome? This book is pure magic. There is just the right amount of drama and I adored the intelligent and supportive secondary characters. Kudos to Nina Bocci for a fabulous debut book! And remember, it is never too late to start something new or make a chance in your life. Just go for it!

 I LOVED this book! It's got Sarina Bowen's trademark humor, hot sex, an irresistible hero and a smart, funny, and slightly insecure heroine. And she's a gamer! Plus there's a serious, very timely message underneath the fantastic romance. This story is fresh, modern and very relevant. You absolutely cannot go wrong with Sarina Bowen's books!!

"4 - 4.5 Enchanting Stars!! 
 Well, I certainly love going into a book not knowing what to exepct. And Grayson's Vow took me by surprise. This is not a ""typical"" Mia Sheridan story but it is magical, enchanting and irresistible nonetheless. Two very strong, sexy and damaged lead characters make this a very memorable story. 
 The story begins in a very gripping way: Kira is desperate, almost homeless, and immediately propositions Grayson Hawthorn with an almost-insane scheme: she must marry in order to gain access to an inheritance from her grandmother. Grayson, too, his desperate: he is about to lose his precious winery, and has reached a dead end due to his prison record. 
 Grayson is sexy, handsome, yet aloof and emotionally closed off. He has been hurt by those he trusted and loved. Kira is also emotionally damaged, but yet she still remains warm and engaging and filled with hope. She is young and impulsive but truly believes marrying Grayson is her only hope. 
 I fell in love with Grayson. He is cruel to most people but when you learn about his past, well, your heart will break for him. And Kira was betrayed by those she trusted most, which could have left her cruel and emotionally cut-off but she still retains the capacity to love. 
 ""In Vino Veritas. In wine there is truth. In love there is truth."" 
 Grayson's Vow is set in and around Napa, California, one of my most favorite places in the world!! I absolutely loved the scenery and the setting. There is also an engaging cast of supporting characters in this book which I loved. There is an air of magic to this book, which adds a bit of whimsy and lightens the emotional heaviness of the plot. There is PLENTY of steam and Grayson is just YUMMY. Who doesn't love a bad boy with a heart of gold? 
 This book is very different from Ms. Sheridan's other books, and gets into some overly-dramatic scenes near the end of the story. I still found this to be a beautiful story about the power of love and acceptance and honesty. And the EPILOGUE...OMG!! A 10+ which had be sobbing happy tears for Grayson and Kira.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 WOW!! What an explosive opening!! Marcus Merritt - another totally swoony book boyfriend from Tia Louise!! ONE TO CHASE is a standalone; however, I highly recommend reading the other books in this series so that you can meet the other characters and fall in love with each and every one. 
 Marcus and Amy Knight are both independent to the extreme. Amy is running from her past and Marcus, well, he just has zero interest in any kind of lasting or deep relationship. This stunning lawyer is sex on a stick and make no mistake, this book is PASSIONATE, fast-paced and totally hot. Amy is back in Chicago after an ill-fated relationship in Paris and this woman is smart, driven and stunning. Tia Louise writes completely believable characters, sympathetic and yet very real at the same time. 
 Marcus cannot stop thinking about Amy, and the title, One to Chase, is very much the story of this book. The playboy might have finally met his equal, in and out of the bedroom. 
 ""Everything in me craves her."" 
 These two have hooked up once before in a previous book and they had an amazingly hot encounter. The sparks are still there. There are some other mean-girl characters here that threaten Marcus and Amy's HEA and I loved how these characters played into the story and at least one of them got what was coming to her in the end. 
 Tia Louise is my go-to author for classically hot contemporary romance stories that are modern, sexy, real and very, very readable. Her characters are memorable, passionate, caring and smart. Give this series a try! You won't be disappointed.

"Well, hmmmm. Although lots of readers raved about this story, it just didn't work for me on many levels. I can live with instalove and instalust, but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever. The storyline is clever and could have made a good book, but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations. There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable. I give the author credit for some interesting ideas, but this book is in need of a good editor. Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not, it completely changed the tone of the scene. ( Usually I purchase the finished book but I didn't in this case.)

"""We didn't always want what was right. We wanted what we couldn't have."" 
 God this book tore me up!!! Gutted me. Enthralled me. Made me feel anxious, sad, elated...all at once. Thank you, Tarryn Fisher, for this magnificent roller-coaster ride of a book. I won't ever forget it. 
 At once magical and painfully realistic, F*CK LOVE is like nothing you've read before. It has some similarities to one of all-time favorite series, The Love Me With Lies books, but it is different, unique and wonderfully, beautifully hopeful and cynical at the same time. Can that be? Tarry Fisher pulls it off with one of the most surprising books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. 
 The story begins with a completely disorienting scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. 
 Kit hit me out of nowhere. I had a dream that made me take a closer look at a guy I was otherwise ignoring. And from that dream I discovered a connection. I don't even think about the dream anymore. For the last eight weeks I've been living it. 
 Yes, the main character Helena has a dream, in which she is living a life completely different from her current path. What will she do with it? Will her dream become her reality? In true Tarryn Fisher form, the author has created a kind, beautiful, smart and very quirky girl, who aches for what she cannot have. 
 ""We have something, Helena. In another life, it would have been a beautiful something."" That hurts. God, does it. I've seen that life. He doesn't even know what he's talking about. In his mind, I'm just some possibility that could have been, but in my mind, he's the only possibility. 
 F*ck Love is a wildly unpredictable book that is poignant and uplifting, funny and tragic, and will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I can't help but wonder how much of this story (if any) is based on real-life events. And yes, I imagine Tarryn Fisher herself as Helena. To me, it is a perfect fit! Don't miss F*ck Love, it is absolutely one of my favorite books of 2016. 
 Favorite Quote: 
 Be gentle with yourself. Embrace the lows so that you can more effectively enjoy the highs. Love the fight. Love it so much, and let it save you when your emotional muscles have become soft.

"""My boobs look enormous in this wedding dress."" 
 I groaned, throwing my arm over my face. ""Are you trying to kill me?"" 
 Christina Lauren's trademark dirty humor and captivating writing style is back in this novella surrounding Will and Hanna's wedding and subesequent struggles with married life. Beautiful Boss is a lovely entry in this series, and fans will love the appearance of the whole gang. Hanna and Will are dealing with the same issues that face most couples today: what will become of the professional woman who wants to utilize her education AND have a family? 
 We got married, yes, but I never signed on to be Susie Homemaker or change who I was. 
 Hanna thinks Will has no faith in her ability to balance both marraige AND her career, but alas, he does, and he is SO proud of all her accomplishments. Join this adorable and sexy couple on their journey and spend a fun few hours with Beautiful Boss. There are tons of sexy times and a little tension in this juicy novella and I adored every minute.

"3.5 Sexy Stars!! 
 I ADORE J. Daniels and was SO excited to read Mason and Brooke's story! Although this is technically a ""crossover"" story between the Alabama Summer series and the Sweet Addiction series, it can most definitely be read as a standalone. 
 This is a perfect book when you are looking for a sweet, very hot and very funny read. The hero and heroine are enormously likable and very relatable. Mason is a helliuva sexy Aussie yoga studio owner who certainly gives commitment-phobe Brooke a run for her money, There is lots of funny dialogue here and lots and lots of hot and heavy fooling around leading up to the smexy times. If you've read any books in this series, you know they are set in a cupcake shop so there's lots of sweet cupcake references here which actually can be quite alluring! 
 Mason is a fantastic Alpha, totally swoony and um. well-endowed in certain areas, but really a romantic at heart. He wants more that just a one-night stand with Brooke. The question is, can she possibly let her guard down and let Mason into her heart before it's too late and she ruins everything? 
 Sweet Addiction is one of my absolute favorite contemporary romances and is a must-read. Here, Mason and Brooke's story felt a little predictable at times but is nonetheless a warm and romantic and very swoony read and will be a hit with all of this author's many fans.

"Butterfly Dreams is the first book I have read by A. Meredith Walters. I know she is a favorite of many readers, so I was thrilled to have the chance to read this book. I adored this story! It is a witty, fast-paced and yes, very emotional story about coming to terms with your life and facing your own mortality. 
 The author has created two very lively and memorable characters in Corin and Beckett. Corin is obsessed with her physical health, convinced that she has a multitude of undiagnosed ailments. She does suffer from panic attacks, but she is sure she is going to die at any minute from a heart attack. 
 She finds her way to a support group for heart patients where she meets Beckett, who has actually suffered a nbear-fatal heart attack and has had his regular day-to-day activities sharply curtailed. He is in the prime of his life but because of his brush with death, now sees everything differently. 
 Corin is morbid and morose while Beckett is warm and funny and outgoing. She looks back on her life while he looks forward: 
 ""Stop thinking about your life in increments. Seconds. Minutes. Days. Look at the bigger picture and embrace whatever time you have. Don't look constantly toward the end. Enjoy the right now."" 
 This story is very funny and balances the serious subjects perfectly with witty banter and sexy times between the two main characters. I really enjoyed this story and recommend it for all fans of New Adult romance. While the conclusion is a bit predictable, the wit, sarcasm and solid writing make Butterfly Dreams a very enjoyable read.

 Classic enemies-to-lovers romance, one that I couldn't put down once I started reading! Hollywood-superstar-meets-ordinary-girl is one of my favorite themes, and Alessandra Torre serves it up with plenty of sexiness, warmth and down-home Southern style. This is a book that could have gotten bogged down in cliches but in the hands of Alessandra Torre, it is a smart, funny, and very insightful peek into the donwside of Hollywood superstardom. I absolutely loved the realistic yet loving portrait of small-town Southern life as painted by Ms. Torre. Although the author is quick to state that this is a contemporary romance and is not like her other books, there is PLENTY of steam and sexy times in this book!! Cole is just irresistibile. And the banter between the hero and heroine is priceless. And no one writes a smart and sassy heroine quite like Alessandra Torre. The only quarrel I had with this story is the portrayal of the legal proceedings involving Brad DeLuca. Meh. Other than that, I loved Hollywood Dirt and found myself with a book hangover after leaving the fictional town of Quincy GA.

"""I wished I could see myself through his eyes. Then again, Damian never looked at me with his eyes. He looked at me with his soul."" 
 Totally unexpected story by the incredible Leylah Attar! Dark and emotional but ultimately passionate and hopeful. A must-read. I couldn't put it down and read it almost in one sitting. 
 After I read 53 LETTERS FOR MY LOVER, I fell in love with Leylah Attar's writing. It is rich, mature, and lush. I couldn't wait until her newest book and was completely intrigued by the synopsis for THE PAPER SWAN. Not much of the plot is given away, for good reason. There is not much I can add to the stellar reviews for this book, other than to say that Ms. Attar has a unique voice and an incredible gift with words. Nothing prepared me for the emotions that I felt while reading The Paper Swan. The characters, the plot, the epilogue - all perfect, unique and gloriously realized. 
 I like a good dark read as much as I love a sexy contemporary romance and this book actually blends these two genres together. My attention has been wandering as of late and I have struggled to finish a lot of the books I have been reading. However, I read The Paper Swan from cover to cover (do Kindles even have ""covers""?) and basically ignored real life until I finished this magnificent story. I don't know how to describe this story other than to say everyone has some redeeming quality, no matter how evil they act, and those whom you think are above criticism might have skeletons in their closet and may not be what they seem. 
 The story is filled with tons of suprising twists, along with a stunning story of survival, redemption and forgiveness Nothing can prepare you for this story or for the depth of emotion you will feel. The dialogue is witty and intelligent and the heroine is smart and loving and very capable. 
 Without giving too much away, this is a story about love, passion, family, hate, revenge and survival. And devotion. 
 ""We are stars with flaws that still sparkle and shine. We always strive, always want, always have more questions than answers, but there are moments like these, full of magic and contentment, when souls get a glimpse of the divine and quite simply, lose their breath."" 
 The Paper Swan is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Based on the synopsis, I went into thinking I was getting one thing, but was surprised with what this book was actually about. There is much more I want to say about this book, but it's hard to without giving anything away. This is just one of those books that it's better to go into blind. The fact that you don't know what to expect makes The Paper Swan even better. 
 I will say that The Paper Swan is an incredibly written book with tons of plot twists and smart characters, The story spans a good amount of time and that adds a richness to the relationship between the two main protagonists. 
 This book is captivating, intense, sexy and funny all in one book. I am still thinking about The Paper Swan weeks after I finished. Simply put, The Paper Swan was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend it highly enough. 5 fantastic stars!!!

 OMG this book!!! A dirty-talking baseball star who quotes Shakespeare? YES, PLEASE! 
 ""I can't decide how to f* you, he says. ""I want to take you in every position. I want to f* you like an animal and a saint. I want to keep you on the brink for an hour and take four orgasms from you. I can't do it all tonight. I'm kind of pissed about that."" 
 Hardball is sexy, heartfelt, exciting, funny, steamy and addictive. I LOVED Dash Wallace! He is seemingly perfect, gorgeous, a gifted athlete, but he is actually filled with compulsions and must adhere to a strict routine at all times. His baseball career and his sanity depend on it. I fell totally in love with this damaged man. 
 The Synopsis to this book doesn't really show the depth of emotion in this book. There is so much more than just the sizzling romance between Dash and Vivian. There is the amazingly detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. There are the wonderful supporting characters, including Vivian's elderly father. There is the constant battle within Dash's head over his ADHD and the obsessive way he deals with routine and his superstitions. 
 Vivian has only had one boyfriend in her life so Dash hits her like a freight train. OMG, their scenes together are on FIRE!!! CD Reiss writes some of the best erotic romance around. And set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and baseball, well, Hardball is just perfection. 
 I LOVED the imperfection of these characters. Vivian and Dash are both insecure in their own way. Vivian doesn't think she's good enough or sexy enough for a glamorous baseball player like Dash. He is battling with his own internal demons. These characters captured my heart. And kudos to CD Reiss for the fabulously detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. 
 I am a huge fan of CD Reiss but even if you've never read one of her books, give Hardball a try. It is glorious.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 DON'T JUDGE is the first book I have read by A.E. Via and it is spectacular! Two Alphas together in a fabulously dirty romance? Yes, please! I peeked at some of the reviews for this book and noted that early copies from Amazon had some editing issues. Rest assured, all of that has been corrected. 
 I have not read the other books in this series and DON'T JUDGE can absolutely be read as a standalone. I actually enjoyed the police-procedure talk because there is plenty of HAWT male-on-male action in this book. The scenes between Judge and Michaels are absolutely some of the steamiest M/M scenes I have EVER read - I mean, this author can really heat up the pages! I loved how Judge thought he was too old for the sexy, younger Austin Michaels, while Michaels, in turn, thought Judge was straight. 
 He chanced a look at Michaels and was shocked to see him slouched and confident riding with him. He had a dark pair of aviator shades on, staring out the window with one hand propped on the door. It was almost as if he didn't know he was hot. And damnit if that wasn't sexy in itself. 
 There is a fast-paced story here and the sexy times built nicely to a fantastic relationship. While there was no Insta-love, there was an instant attraction between these two stunning, sexy men: 
 It was the thick, silky, straight black hair the spanned across that broad chest that had Michaels' mouth watering. Turn and look away, turn and look away. There was no way a guy like Judge was gay. If those dark eyes popped open and caught him gawking, then he was going to have a whole other set of problems. 
 A.E. Via's books are new to me and I adored this one. The banter and passion between Judge and Michaels is sexy, intense and very readable. And did I mention the sex is off the charts? I loved how Judge doubted himself, and almost ruined his chances with Michaels. But there was no false or forced drama here, just real emotions between two very real men. 
 This was the man of Judge's dreams, but he was fighting it all the way. He wouldn't put himself back out there. Partners left you or they died on you; one or the other; but either way, you were left behind, devastated. Judge was too old to do devastated. 
 I absolutely loved DON'T JUDGE and am looking forward to reading more books by this author.

 Ethan Dexter is SMOKING HOT and sweet as sugar - my favorite combination!! 
 ""Just say the word and you can have me, Fiona."" 
 AS you can read from the synopsis, Ethan ""Dex"" Dexter is a pro football player who also happens to be a virgin. The author did an fabulous job with this part of the story (it is a romance, after all) and I totally believed the sweet-hot feelings that Dex and Fiona had for each other. First and foremost, this is a love story with fantastic steamy sex scenes and perfectly witty and funny banter between the characters. 
 Dex and Fi met years earlier and he has never forgotten her. She is a smart and feisty woman who is not so sure she wants to jump into a relationship with a professional football player who also happens to live in an other city. I loved how Dex practically wore his heart on his sleeve, which to me, made him all the more irresisitbile. Ms. Callihan writes loving, sexy men, and Dex is no exception. And the beard, tattoos and, ahem, piercings only added to his allure. 
 ""I want you badly enough to put all my cards on the table, show who I really am. So I guess it's your play now."" 
 I read this book almost non-stop and adored each and every character! Dex and Fi went through some difficult times and not all was sunshine and roses for them. The Game Plan is perfect for when you want a very sexy but light and fast-paced sports romance that will make you laugh out loud and TOTALLY swoon over the story's hero. I also loved how the author portrayed the trials and tribulations of living life in the public eye, and how Dex and Fi dealt with the very public intrusion into their private lives. 
 Kristen Callihan has quickly become one of my favorite writers. Enjoy sexy Dex!!

"4.5 STARS!! 
 ""Freedom is so close I can taste its bitterness on the tip of my tongue.: 
 What a stunning story!! I adored this tortured tale of Low and Poesy, two star-crossed lovers who spend much of the book on the run from the authorities after a string of bank robberies. It is a tribute to the talent of Mary Elizabeth that you actually feel tremendous sympathy for Low, the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose life seems doomed from the first page. 
 Low has the misfortune to have a criminal for a father and to be dirt-poor. A petty crime lands him in prison with hardened criminals who teach him how to rob banks. When he is released, he tries desperately to live on the right side of the law. But poverty, hunger and sheer desperation drive him to a string of crimes, with the loyal Poesy right by his side. She is absolutely devoted to him. 
 ""I'm here,"" she chose in a for-sure tone. ""We did this together, and anything we do together is right, Low."" 
 I spent most of this book on the edge of my seat, in a constant state of anxiety for the handsome, sad Low and his beautiful Poesy. He is desperate to live a simple, normal life. Low is not at all greedy, but he just wants to be able to eat, help Poesy with school and help his own family. They seem doomed from the start but they overcome so many obstacles that I was cheering for them throughout the book. 
 LOW is a fast-paced, very gritty story that is incredibly addictive. This was my first book by Mary Elizabeth and I am in love with her writing style!! I loved LOW and I hope for more about these two unforgettable characters.

"Ruin & Rule ended with a stunning cliffhanger. . . and Sin & Suffer continues the thrilling, sizzling rollercoaster of a ride! 
 Arthur ""Kill"" Killian must devise a scheme to get his true love away back from his sick, twisted father. He is a broken man but he will stop at nothing to wreak revenge on his ""family."" At the same time, how can he possibly protect Cleo from the evils that surround her? 
 ""Cleo eclipsed everything. She was my Sagittarius, my soul mate, my best friend. Not only had I failed her once and persecuted us to eight years apart, but she'd also been harmed twice at my father's hand. She'd suffered more than she ever should and it was all because of me and my need to settle the score. I wanted to forget about my goal--to halt the guillotine hovering over both our futures--because if I didn't, if I continued chasing death, then I didn't deserve her. And I want so fucking much to deserve her."" 
 Cleo is battling her own devastating past, but like all Pepper Winters' books, Cleo is one kick-ass heroine who is strong, stubborn and resilient. Kill is her soulmate, her true love since childhood and she can withstand almost anything now that she knows he is back in her life. 
 ""There hadn't been a single moment in the past eight years when I'd awoken and wished I could forget. 
 Every morning had been a struggle to remember. 
 Every night a battle between needing to know and needing to forget."" 
 Sin & Suffer has TONS of twists and turns. I love MC books so this book was a pleasure to read. It is not quite as dark as Ruin & Rule, but it is just as thrilling and satisfying. Cleo and Kill are two unforgettable characters and I loved the conclusion that Ms. Winters gave to them in Sin & Suffer.

"4.5 - 5 DARK STARS!! 
 Freedom. 
 I had it. 
 But then, I lost it. 
 This is Pepper Winters are her VERY darkest, very close in tone to the fantastic Monsters in the Dark Series but even darker!! Be warned that the first half of this book is quite grim, and follows the imprisonment of young Tasmin (now called Pim) at the hands of a sadistic monster. There is scene after scene of graphic physical abuse (along with sexual abuse.) The Indebted Series (one of my favorite series ever) might not even be as dark as Pennies. As much as I absolutely adore Q and Jethro, I have high hopes for the mysterious and ruthless Elder Prest!! But don't be fooled, he is as black-hearted as they come and explicitly warns Pim that he is no hero. 
 I wasn't a nice man. 
 I was a tormentor. A killer. A thief. 
 And I wanted to steal her courage drop by fucking drop. 
 After all this darkness in Pennies, I just KNOW that Pepper Winters will craft an unforgettable romance between Prest and Pim, as only she can do. After all, a very wise author told me that you ""gotta start dark to enjoy the light."" 
 The writing is excellent as always, very suspenseful and very descriptive and yet never revealing too much about Prest or about the future storyline. The ending left me hopeful and wanting more. I can't wait to finish this dark journey with Prest and Pim!

"Loved the newest book from one of my favorite authors! This book has it all: world-famous rock stars, SMOKING hot sex, and a very engaging storyline. And we get to visit with some of our favorite Sinners. 
 I have devoured all of Ms. Cunning's previous books, I mean, who doesn't love the mega-hot rockers of the Sinners on Tour series? Those were among the first books I read when I started reading romance. And the new Exodus End book doesn't disappoint in the steam department, this book has everything and more in the sexytimes department. 
 Ms. Cunning once again writes an immensely readable and incredibly HAWT story, this time involving the virginal and very sweet Toni who is hired to write an interactive biography of the band. Something about her attracts Logan, the sexy, Mr. Hot Rocker, who actually finds her innocence an incredible turn-on! Their scenes together are, um, breathtaking and will leave you with a new respect for there writing talents of Olivia Cunning. 
 There is a very sweet story involving Toni's family life, she is leaving behind her special needs sister to go on tour with Exodus End. Her mother is the owner of publishing company that Toni works for andI loved the tension between her mother and Toni over the company. There is lots of drama involving a co-worker who does't have Toni's best interests at heart. 
 Our favorite Sinners all make appearances here and it was great meeting up with them again, 
 But the heart of this story is the wonderful sexual awakening of Toni and the hands of Logan, I mean, Olivia Cunning can write a sex scene like no other! Toni is very endearing and not your typical flashy, sexy groupie that Logan would normally go for. Their scenes together also have a lot of heart to them. I adored this first book in the Exodus End series and I can't wait to read about the other band members! I hope there will be more!

"WOW. Kristen Ashley does it again with Logan and Millie's story. Just when I think I can't love this author any more, she takes my breath away with yet another absolutely magnificent book. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!! 
 I am a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and Walk Through Fire might be one of my all-time favorites in this genre. Everything I love about Ms. Ashley's writing is here: an older couple, a smart but damaged woman, an Alpha male and lots and lots of ridiculously hot sex. I could go on and on about the gorgeous moments in this book but really, you should just read it and experience the emotions for yourself. I got the same feelings in this book as I did in Soaring, and while it takes a lot for me to cry while reading a book, I cried plenty while reading Millie and Logan's story. 
 You learn right off the bat that Logan was Millie's first true love and that things ended suddenly between them years earlier. Jump forward and Millie runs into Logan and just the sound of his voice stuns her and she feels compelled to explain to him what happened decades before. He has been married and had children but Millie has spent the years alone, although successful in her business and very close to her own family. Logan, who hasn't seemed to have gotten over Millie walking away from him, is still bitter and is very, very cruel to Millie when she tries to explain her behavior to him: 
 ""I'm done not because I'm done but because there's nothing left of me to burn. You have it all! You've always had it all! I gave up everything so you could have it all! Please! God! Leave me to my nothing!"" 
 I don't want to spoil the story but you will probably guess Millie's reasons for suddenly breaking up with Logan pretty early on in the story. As bitter as Logan is towards Millie, you know that eventually these two will have their HEA but their path there is both beautiful and very bittersweet at the same time. 
 There is a mature aspect to this story which drew me in from the first page. These aren't kids or twenty-somethings, these characters are all adults, with their own kids, careers, families, and relationships to deal with. i absolutely loved how Logan's ex-wife was portrayed in this book and how Millie interacted with her. Oh, and did I mention the sex in this book is completely hot?? Because of course, you know that it is!! I don't often re-read books but I have already re-read parts of Walk Through Fire while I wait (not so) patiently for the next book from Ms. Ashley.

"3.5 Stars!! 
 Lauren Dane writes an super-sexy story, with a couple who have some piercings in very, um, key places! 
 Ms. Dane has written some of my favorite and sexiest contemporary romance novels (The Brown Family series is a favorite and highly recommended - they are totally addictive.) Opening Up is the first in her new Ink and Chrome series. The plot is light, steamy, funny, fast-paced and pretty much angst-free. 
 I couldn't wait to dive into this book and I read it one sitting. PJ is a young, strong-willed woman who breaks free from her overbearing family and ventures out on her own in the world off body shop painting. She meets Asa, who is older, totally domineering and sex-on-a-stick. He accepts her for who she is and their sex is, to put it mildly, off the charts. Think multiple piercings, sexy tattoos and passionate car sex! 
 ""You're defiling her in your head right now, aren't you?"" 
 Hell yes. 
 There is nothing too dramatic or earth shattering in this book. I loved the chemistry between PJ and Asa and you will need a fan for their scenes together. OPENING UP is the perfect summertime read to take to the pool or beach, and the secondary characters are just as enjoyable! (I cannot wait for Duke, Asa's friend, to get his story in FALLING UNDER, coming out in August. Hello! Can you say huge, tattooed and sexy?) All in all, OPENING UP is a passionate, funny, dirty and light summer read with a HEA. Enjoy! 
 ""Wait. I want to see you put the condom on over the piercing. I should know this. For future reference.""

"Sweet and unexpectedly romantic and SEXY!! I love a story with a single mom and The Offer has that plus much more. I loved all the characters in this book, plus Steph and Lident make appearances as well. However, you do not need to have read The Pact to enjoy this story. Nicola is living on the edge, trying to make a home for her daughter Ava but struggling to make ends meet since Ava's dad is absent. Along comes Bram, who seems to be quite the sexy player, confident and bold. 
 But Bram isn't what he seems, there's more than meets the eye here, and after some amazing chemsitry and hot sex, Nicole finds herself falling for Bram. There is no Insta-love here, Nicola and Bram's banter is great and she does not instantly fall for his moves. 
 I loved Ava, and Ms. Halle writes the scenes with her with great compassion and understanding. Ava is adorable. But sexy-talking Bram is the star here, and I really liked how he had many different sides to his personality. This is a classic contemporary romance, with modern characters, genuine dialogue and very realistic situations. 
 There is a wonderful Epilogue plus a suprising twist which was all very satisfying. The Offer is a great summer read, full of sexy times, great banter and very sympathetic characters.

"PRIEST is a wonderfully dirty, very adult and immensely readable book from Sierra Simone. EVERYTHING about this story worked for me, from the mostly male POV, to the smoking hot sex scenes and the very sympathetic characters. 
 No surprises in the storyline: Father Tyler Bell is tempted by the smart and beautiful Poppy Danforth and they begin a torrid affair that sorely tests his faith and his commitment to the priesthood. I immediately connected with both of these characters and sympathized with Tyler's deep yearning and longing for Poppy: 
 ""I was supposed to be a shepherd of the flock, not the wolf. 
 Not the wolf who had woken up this morning grinding his hips into the mattress because he'd had a very intense dream with Poppy and her carnal sins in a starring role. Guilt wormed through me at the memory."" 
 Poor Father Bell! Everything he worked so hard for was in jeopardy. I absolutely loved his internal dialogue and the backstory that led him to join the priesthood. If anyone was ever NOT cut out to take a vow of celibacy, it was certainly Tyler Bell, but he really loves his parish and congregants. I also thought the black humor worked really well here, as a counterbalance to the fairly serious themes of the book: 
 ""I could do this. There was life after fucking up, after all, even for those who lived without fucking."" 
 Both Tyler and Poppy realize quickly that they not only can they not keep their hands off each other, but they both have very deep feelings for each other. Tyler truly cared about Poppy, and he was risking everything for her. Their scenes together are just...irresistible! 
 ""Was I only telling myself I cared about her spiritual development, so that I could be near her? No, I decided. That for sure wasn't true. It was just that the actual truth was so much worse. I cared about her as a person, as a soul, and I wanted to fuck her, and that was the recipe for something much worse than carnal sin. It was a recipe for falling in love."" 
 PRIEST is an incredibly enjoyable, sexy, and yes, sometimes even funny story. I plan to read the author's other books because I loved this one so much. PRIEST is simply outstanding! 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""Pursue righteousness, the author of Timothy said. But did righteousness carry a bottle of Macallan 12 in her hand? Because Poppy did."" 
 ""Be good be good be good, I told myself as I approached her. Don't jump her bones. Don't fantasize about fucking her tits. Be a good priest.""

"I absolutely fell in love with this book and the characters. This is a very adult, very difficult story and is certainly not for everyone; it is painfully real, messy and passionate and I loved every single word. 
 I wanted to find someone who belonged with me like the stars belonged with the sky. Someone I could get lost in, who would make me forget about reality for a while, who would adore me second to none. 
 Affairytale is a book that fascinated me, at times made me cringe, enthralled me and in the end, captivated me with its realism, beauty and ultimately very hopeful message. This is the non-fiction account of the author meeting her soulmate, while promised to another. C.J. actually meets Grant, the great love of her life, before she marries Levi, the father of her child. She knows in her heart of hearts that Levi is not the right man for her, but he was a good father and she wanted to make a home for their child. 
 I craved him. I needed him, I was myself when I was with him. I had married the wrong person, there I had become the wrong person. 
 This story is gripping on so many levels. The reader is a witness to the destruction of a marriage. It should have never occurred in the first place and it takes a very long time for the author to come to terms with the reality of her situation. The story takes place over many years and is much, much more than just the tale of two people destined to be together. It is an exploration of becoming the best person you can be, living each day to the fullest and living your life with honesty. That might seem out of place in a review of a book like this but events unfolded the way they were meant to, and in a way that was gritty, painful, real and finally, very uplifting and joyous. 
 I didn't always agree with C.J.'s actions or her behavior toward Levi. But she and Grant were always meant to be, even if took them years to get there. Her struggle with chronic back pain, along with the realities of her brutally painful relationship with Levi, were so honest that I could not put this book down and still find myself thinking about it days after finishing. 
 There is no question that this story is not for everyone. But it is an honest account of two people's path to happiness and truth and for that alone, I applaud the author for putting her story out there. The inclusion of text messages and love letters was brilliant and only added to the feelings and emotions I have for this book! If you are looking for a very challenging and very thought-provoking story, then do no miss Affairytale. It is one of my favorite books this year.

"Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Each of her stories is richly detailed, deeply felt and intensely sexy. Better When It Hurts is no exception. Although I have not read Love the Way You Lie, I was able to jump right in to Blue and Lola's story here. Both are very damaged characters who had to learn how to survive on their own from a young age. 
 These two have a long past together which is why Blue insists on acting as security on the nights she dances at the club where they both work. Lola tries to put on a tough exterior but her toughness is just an act that is in part driven by guilt over what happened between the two of them when they were foster kids. This is a gritty story but as with all Skye Warren books, the sex scenes are totally hot and very, very intense. 
 Lola is not always the most likable character but she is very real and just trying to do what she has to in order to survive. Blue is totally Alpha, sexy, domineering and despite the hard exterior, is a guy with a heart. These two have incredible chemistry. If you like grittier stories with lots of erotic scenes and the right touch of romance, then Better When It Hurts is for you! Another great story from Skye Warren.

"""You're only alive if you bruise."" 
 WOW. I finished ACED a while back, but it has taken me some time to write a review because of the raw emotion in this book and the feelings it awakened in me. Although I connected with Colton and Rylee from the very first book in this series, this time around the couple are experiencing ""real-life"" trials and tribulations that I think almost anyone can relate to. 
 Rylee's experience in this book touched me so deeply that I had to distance myself from this book for a bit after I finished. I read this book when I was going though a very similar experience, which made this book all the more personal and real to me. In my opinion, Ms. Bromberg got these emotions so right, that I find it hard to believe she hasn't experienced them first-hand. Bravo again, Ms. Bromberg, for perfectly nailing an incredibly painful and private subject and hitting it out of the park. 
 Of the many romance books that I have read, Colton Donavan remains one of my all-time favorite book boyfriends. And that is no small feat. What is even more endearing about him in ACED is that he has matured, grown emotionally and become a more sensitive and loving man here, not only with Rylee, but with his family as well. *SWOON* I don't think anyone can come close to Colton in terms of pure sex-appeal!! 
 ""What we have between us,"" he says, voice thick with emotion as he pauses to find the words, ""is a beautiful thing."" ""A beautiful thing is never perfect,"" I murmur. ""You're right. We're far from perfect. We're perfectly imperfect."" 
 ACED is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, the perfect conclusion to the unforgettable story of Colton and Rylee. ACED is K. Bromberg at her finest. Colton Donavan will steal your heart. Again. I adored this book and didn't want it to end!

"4.5 SMOKING Hot Stars!! 
 HIM is a totally sexy story mixed with the perfect amount of sweet, passionate romance. Wes and Jamie are absolutely delicious together. Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy have become two of my favorite authors!! 
 I read a fair amount of M/M romance books, so I approached HIM with a wary eye. Would it have enough steam for me? Would the two heroes only dance around their attraction for each other, but never really get down to business? Would the dialogue be witty enough to hold my pathetically short attention span? 
 The answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!! 
 Because I adored Elle Kennedy's Off Campus series and loved Sarina Bowen's The Shameless Hour, I was thrilled to be able to read their collaboration together. And once I started reading HIM, I literally could NOT put this book down! Jamie Canning and Ryan 'Wes' Wesley were perfectly real characters to me and the writing style so seamless, that I could not tell which author wrote which chapter, scene or verse. Even if you're new to the M/M genre, I highly recommend this book for the witty banter, sexy times and catchy plot. Two hot hockey players? Yes please!! 
 Jamie and Wes were childhood friends who lost touch after a youthful incident that caused an unfortunate miscommunication. Lo and behold, they run into each other years later and both realize that they have been the ""missing link"" in each other's lives. But does Jamie just want to be friends with Wes? Set among the world of college hockey, HIM delivers the perfect amount of hot, dirty, sweet emotion as both Wes and Jamie learn to come to terms with their true feelings. Wes has always loved Jamie and finds it difficult to keep their relationship platonic. 
 ""As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot. As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves. 
 My weakness is him."" 
 I absolutely LOVED how the authors wrote a seamless story that perfectly illustrated the difficulties that gay sports players must face. Wes and Jamie were perfectly suited for each other, even if Jamie at first was reluctant to admit his true feelings for Wes. And Wes, on the other hand, is a total commitment-phone, never allowing anyone to get too close, and hopping from meaningless encounter to another. 
 ""The fact that he'd been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myself...well, all that will go unsaid."" 
 HIM is a feel-good sports romance that happens to feature two fabulously sexy male protagonists. It is perfect for die-hard readers of M/M romance as well as for readers who are new to the genre. I adored this book and hope that Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy collaborate on many more books in the future!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 I'm a huge fan of LP Lovell so when I heard she was writing a book with Stevie Cole, I thought, ""Sign me up!"" I had the pleasure of reading an early copy of Wrong and it was right up my alley. I loved every rough, violent and sexy minute of this story! If you're a fan of darker books, run, don't walk, to grab a copy of Wrong. This books bursts out of the gate at 100 MPH and doesn't stop until the last page. 
 Our heroine is Victoria, a smart woman who has a brilliant career ahead of her and a boyfriend to boot. In the blink of an eye, everything she thought she was sure of changes, and her life is immediately turned upside down. Victoria is strong-willed, no shrinking violet, and cannot believe that this criminal named Jude might possibly have some kind of hold on her. 
 ""This should feel wrong, but it doesn't. 
 Maybe I'm more broken then I thought."" 
 Jude is not an easy character but despite the fact that he is a seasoned criminal, um, I loved him!! That's right. He's HAWT, sexy, rough ... and he kills people. He made quite an impression on me thanks to the skillful writing of these two authors. Wrong is a thriller so be prepared for some pretty graphic scenes. But the action and the heat between the two MC's is so incredibly well-written that I could not put this book down. Jude might have a heart buried somewhere deep down inside, even though he tries desperately to ignore the feelings that Victoria brings out in him: 
 ""I'm wrong for what I've done to her, and I fear I'm wrong for letting her leave me like this, but the thing is, I've never known how to be right. This is all I know, and I know she doesn't belong in the middle of it."" 
 I highly recommend this book for all fans of the dark romance genre and I can't wait to read more from this writing duo!",5,5,1,343,35.18,12.93,49.68,16.88,16.33,12.24,89.5,76.38,60.93,18.08,11.95,6.41,0.29,0.29,4.66,0.0,6.12,17.2,7.87,1.17,13.7,11.08,4.37,6.71,2.92,18.95,7.58,3.21,2.04,1.17,0.58,0.29,12.24,1.75,9.91,2.92,0.87,1.17,2.33,0.29,3.5,0.0,7.29,3.5,3.79,2.04,1.17,0.87,0.29,0.29,0.0,0.0,12.54,6.12,0.29,0.29,0.29,2.62,1.46,6.41,0.0,0.29,3.21,2.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.04,0.0,0.0,2.04,0.0,0.0,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.58,0.0,0.29,0.29,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.54,11.08,0.29,2.33,4.96,1.46,0.29,1.75,3.79,4.08,7.87,1.17,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.29,0.0,20.7,5.54,6.12,0.0,2.04,4.37,2.62,0
"SMOKING hot, funny and surprisingly endearing! Elle Kennedy writes the wittiest banter around. I really loved this story and Dean is absolutely irresistible! 
 The Score follows two characters from Elle's earlier books. Allie is a drama major and Dean is studying law. Allie may be my favorite Elle Kennedy heroine so far! She is smart, funny, and yes, emotional. At first I thought she was a little weak, coming off of her break-up with her boyfriend, but this girl knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it! 
 And DEAN...well, lets just say he started off with a bang for me, literally, plus I am one of those readers who loves a cocky guy! Dean comes from a wealthy family and he has certain expectations placed on him...what courses he'll study, what profession he'll go into...his whole life is mapped out for him. But he is HILARIOUS (hello, Twilight reference?) and on top of his sexiness, he is a sweet, caring guy. When he started coaching the kids' hockey team... well, let's just say I was a goner at that point. Oh, and did I mention Dean is a dirty-talker? YES, PLEASE! 
 ""I though you said you didn't want to salsa dance. And Dean De Laurentis only does what he wants, remember?"" 
 He shrugs. ""I am doing what I want."" 
 My eyebrows knit together as I wait for him to clarify. 
 ""I'm making you happy."" 
 Allie and Dean seem mismatched but guess what, they fit together perfectly! What's starts off as a sex-with-no-strings relationship of course turns into much more...but that is the beauty of Elle Kennedy's writing. There is nothing predictable here and there are tons of twists and turns along the way to Dean and Allie's HEA. With lots of witty banter and funny dialogue, smoking-hot sex and a little angst, THE SCORE is a fresh and modern romance that I devoured. I adored Dean and Allie together and can't wait for the next book! (What? Did you say Tucker?)

"Thus author has a wonderful writing style and tackles a very serious topic with a great deal of sensitivity and honesty. That being said, I felt that the themes were dealt with in a somewhat simplistic manner that just didn't quite work out for me. There were certain crucial details that just didn't make sense to me and unfortunately, interfered with my overall enjoyment of the book. Lots of readers absolutely adore this one, but I just couldn't quite connect with the characters. I will definitely read other books by this author and I applaud her for writing about this very weighty issue,",4,3,1,103,35.78,1.1,45.35,95.19,20.6,23.3,88.35,77.67,61.17,14.56,7.77,6.8,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.0,6.8,18.45,6.8,0.97,13.59,5.83,13.59,4.85,2.91,14.56,6.8,3.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.53,0.0,15.53,2.91,0.97,0.0,4.85,1.94,4.85,0.0,5.83,5.83,0.0,3.88,3.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.8,4.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.97,3.88,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.88,0.0,0.0,3.88,0.0,0.0,1.94,1.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.0,3.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,6.8,0.0,0.97,2.91,0.0,0.97,1.94,0.0,5.83,1.94,0.97,0.97,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.0,10.68,3.88,3.88,0.0,0.0,2.91,0.0,0
"Russell. He is everything! Make Me serves up a healthy dose of steamy sex plus some really great comedic moments! 
 Although Book #3 in Tessa Bailey's Broke and Beautiful series, this scorching book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel and is sexy, FUNNY and fast-paced. MAKE ME is pure Tess Bailey gold! Abby and Russell's story is an enjoyable, delicious book, written as always in the trademark Tess Bailey style of dirty-talking Alphas with a healthy dose of reality, humor and solid storyline. 
 I was hooked from the hilarious opening line of this book. Russell is a blue-collar construction worker who thinks he will never be good enough for Abby, who comes from a wealthy family but is insanely attracted to Russell. She doesn't quite know how to move their friendship to the next level. Russell, on the other hand, fantasizes constantly about the irresistible Abby and is driven by the need to protect her. Will these two ever be able to move their relationship past the dreaded friend zone? Tessa Bailey writes some of the best growly, sexy Alpha heroes and Russell is no exception. As with all of Ms. Bailey's books, you will need to have a cold shower ready while reading MAKE ME, but the sexiness is mixed in with the perfect amount of extremely witty banter and memorable characters. I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of scorching hot New Adult contemporary romance!

"3.5 - 4 Stars!! 
 I really liked FLAME! The storyline and the love scenes and the action scenes are all fantastic!! 
 Dakota finds herself taking a road trip with friends while she is on a break from school. Dakota goes along with Levi, Gunner and Emmy Sue on a trip for Levi and Gunner's motocross bike races. Levi is HOT but Dakota stays away from relationships. So this trip is perfect for the both of them: a hot hook-up with no promise of anything permanent. I loved Dakota's character: she is smart, strong-willed and not afraid to go after what she wants But when the road trip ends, will she be able to walk away from Levi? 
 Dakota is from an unconventional family and I love how her free spirit shines through in this book. Levi is immediately attracted to her spirit but he is very honest about not wanting anything more than sex while they are on the road. He doesn't ""do"" relationships either. But is he ever HOT!! 
 ""Sunshine,"" Levi leans over to me, resting his hand on the inside of my thigh, right below the frayed hem of my shorts, ""I promise I want to learn all about your family. They sound cool as fuck--especially the part about the weed farm--but can we get back to where you said motocross is driving fast and doing stupid, crazy-ass stunts while flying through the air? 'Cause if you're gonna be my girl on this trip, we need to give you a crash course tonight in all things motocross, so you can truly appreciate my awesomeness when you see me in action."" 
 These two have some great banter and the action scenes are incredible! Although this is the second book in a series, it can absolutely be read as a standalone. If you love a great new adult romance with plenty of sizzle and smart, witty banter, then you will LOVE FLAME!",7,4,1,323,50.46,58.49,33.61,96.55,17.94,11.76,84.52,70.9,57.28,13.93,10.84,3.41,0.62,2.48,3.41,0.93,3.1,13.93,6.81,1.24,14.55,8.36,4.95,9.29,1.24,14.86,6.5,3.72,2.79,2.48,0.31,0.0,12.69,1.55,10.84,1.24,0.62,2.17,1.24,1.86,4.33,0.0,7.74,6.81,0.62,2.79,2.48,0.31,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.31,13.62,4.33,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.93,9.29,0.0,0.93,2.79,1.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.24,0.31,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.93,0.62,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.43,10.53,0.31,2.79,5.26,0.62,0.62,1.24,4.33,1.24,7.43,1.24,0.62,0.31,0.31,0.0,0.0,17.34,3.41,4.02,0.62,2.79,1.55,4.95,0
"(Reviewed by Cathy): 
 4.5 Stars!! 
 Let me start be saying that I am obsessed with all 3 of these books by Bink Cummings. I literally read first two in the same day! I knew nothing about this author or her series and then I told all everyone I knew to read these book! 
 Book 3 delivers some bombshells and some amazingly HOT scenes. There is also some suspense here. These books are written in a very unique style that kept me turning the pages until the very end. I cannot wait for the next book from this author, which will be told from Big's perspective! There is a teaser of this at the end of Book 3. 
 OMG, I adored Bink and loved all her friends, who, by the way, I really want to be one of!! It's great to have an MC story that is based on real life, told from a ""biker chick's"" perspective. The sex is as HOT as her man ""Big""!!! Hello!! This third book explores the unusual relationship between Bink and her man. These two are incredibly stubborn but I absolutely loved their banter and their story! If you are looking for something different to read, I highly recommend this series for a fantastic, very quick, really hot, and entertaining read!!! Run, don't walk, to grab these books!!

"Fresh, light, sexy and funny! 
 I absolutely adore R.S. Grey's books. She has a fresh wit, a wonderful way with banter and can write sexy times as well as the best erotica author. This book is pure fun, a feel-good, sexy read with a HEA and a Cinderella feel to the story. It is a modern tale of a small-town girl trying to make it in the Big Apple, living on a shoestring budget but trying in the best Mary-Tyler-Moore fashion ""to make it on her own."" 
 Jo is a scrappy heroine, and thrilled to land her dream job with a famous fashion house in New York City. Of course her boss is Mr. Sexy Julian Lefray, and the sparks fly between these two right from the get-up. I love a good male POV and Ms. Grey writes a great one! Plus, this book has the just right amount of sex, it was a great ""palate cleanser"" in between the super-steamy and graphic contemporary romance and erotic books I normally read. 
 This book is great if you are looking for a fun, light, sexy and witty book, with great banter between the hero and heroine and some really funny dialogue. It is a modern tale of love and sex and firendship in the big city and I highly recommend it. You can't go wrong with a book by R.S. Grey!

"Cat Porter has written a magical, intense, sexy and incredibly satisfying story. Boner made my heart race and captured my soul! 
 ""You reminded me that there's still magic,"" he whispered roughly. ""That there are things of wonder still left to experience."" 
 I am a HUGE fan of MC Romance books and Cat Porter is at the top of my list of favorite authors in this genre! Lock & Key, the first book in this series, remains one of my all-time favorite books. Random & Rare contented the experience of her absolutely flawless writing and now we have the third book in the series, which is Boner and Jill's story. 
 Boner is a total bad-ass, who has been attracted to Jill for a long time but won't act on it. He's too old for her; she isn't sure she wants to go back to club life again; etc. etc. Jill had been with Catch, another biker and the father of her child, and it ended badly. But who can resist Boner, the sexy biker with a painful past? And how he got his road name...well, you'll have to read for yourself! It's not what you think. I fell in love with him and hoped that Jill could help him overcome his demons. 
 ""Was I only pieces patched together by a leather vest?"" 
 Even though Boner think Jill is off-limits, he offers her his protection and let's just say things progress from there. At first, their ""relationship"" is just for show but since this is a romance after all, they both quickly come to realize they have real feelings for each other. And the Victoria's Secret scene? Oh my God!!! My favorite. 
 I loved reading about Boner's painful past and the action scenes are fantastic. While this doesn't knock out Lock & Key as one of my all-time favorite books, it is a fantastic, sexy, fast-paced and passionate story which I enjoyed immensely. The Epilogue was superb! All in all, Iron & Bone is another must-read book from the incredibly talented Cat Porter.

"Sweet and SMOKIN' HOT!! 
 A juicy, warm and very funny love letter from J. Daniels to the fans of the Alabama Summer series. Any parent can relate to the frustrations these two feel when just trying to get a little ""alone time."" But mixed in with the author's trademark style of smexy writing and Alpha men, and you get a totally hot, adorable, and very readable story for fans of the series. 
 This novella is one more reason why I adore this author and her books. They are all well-written, sweet and 
 super-sexy and offer some wonderful escapist reading when you are looking for some down-home, Southern-style lovin'. I highly recommend this latest installment in one of my favorite series!

"LOVE this series!! Mason's story was passionate, sexy and warm. 
 I adore every single book that Ms. Salsbury has written and Mason's story is no exception. He was the one who lost Eve to Cam so I was looking forward to his book. Because he has been burned in the past by women, he is very cynical with lots of sharp edges but really has a huge heart; so I was anxious for him to get his HEA. 
 What I love about this series is that even though there is a common fighting theme throughout, each character and each story are all very unique. None of these books are repetitive or ever lose their edge. Fighting For Forever is warm, sexy, passionate and filled with thrills. The ending was stunning and beautiful. I am seriously swooning over Mason! He will stop at nothing to protect his Trix, an exotic dancer who is trying to uncover information on her dead sister. That is all I am going to say about the plot because you should read this without any spoilers. 
 Mason is all sexy Alpha, but with a sweet side that was beautiful to see. He will do anything to protect Trix and help her on her quest to locate information on her sister. 
 ""'Love you too baby.' Even though loving her is probably going to kill me."" 
 I love the boys of the Fighting series and Mason is just a dream. I absolutely adored this book and of course can't wait to see what Ms. Salsbury has in store for us next!!

"""Together we flew and together we drifted down to earth, to his bed, his room, this world, this life. Ending still with Coert and me. Yes, it was glorious."" 
 I don't know how she does it but Kristen Ashley has written yet another sparkling gem of a story. Emotional, heart-warming, sexy and heart-breaking, this book has EVERYTHING I love. There's a tough-talking, over-protective Alpha, a sweet and steely but damaged heroine and lots and lots of family goodness. There is nothing like a good, old-fashioned second-chance romance as only KA can do it!! 
 The 'Magadalene' series is one of my favorites and while this book can be read as a standalone, I HIGHLY recommend reading the other books in the series!! They are GOLDEN. Set in a beautiful Maine town, I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed descriptions of architecture, seasons, local food (of course) and the tight-knit bond of the local townspeople. This book launches right into the reasons why Cady has moved to town: she purchased the crumbling lighthouse because not only does her estranged brother live nearby, but the love of her life, Coert, is the sheriff. She is determined to make amends with both of them. But Coert makes it VERY clear right from the beginning that she is to stay away from him at all costs. What happened between them all those years ago to make him so bitter? And exactly how and why has Cady changed so much from the young rebellious girl she once was? 
 Cady and Coert's epic love began many years before in Colorado. Cady ran with a wild crowd and her family did not approve of her choices or her lifestyle. But Cady was always self-sufficient and independent and worked long hours at a dead-end job just to make ends meet. She wanted a better life for herself. She doesn't meet Coert under the best of circumstances but their love was real. A terrible turn of events tears them apart and just like that, the only beautiful thing Cady had was gone. 
 Cady and Coert then spend many years apart. When they meet again in Magdalene, they both have huge misconceptions about each other. But they are both older and wiser and hopefully won't make the same mistakes again. I absolutely LOVED how Kristen Ashley brought these two together again and I was literally sobbing reading much of this book. The story is long, it is weighty and it is hugely satisfying. 
 ""I was in love with Coert Yeager in a way that it just simply would never die."" 
 This glorious story features cameo appearances by characters from the 'Rock Chick' series (yay!) and it is filled with light and love and hope and smoking hot romance. Grab a bottle of wine, settle in and enjoy the ride!! Thanks again to Ms. Ashley for another unforgettable second-chance romance.

"3.5-4 stars, interesting idea that had some exciting moments but overall I had a few issues that interfered with my enjoyment of the story. I did like the main characters and the New York setting. The writing is very good but I felt the story completely sugar-coated the jail setting; this is a fairy-tale, romanticized view of prison life. I also felt the ending was unrealistic with respect to Carter dealing with a corporate matter (I don't want to give away any spoilers here.) Most readers would not be bothered by that turn of events but I had a tough time with it. I did really appreciate the development of the characters and the overall story idea. I had high hopes for this book and for that reason I will definitely give the author's next books a try.",12,4,1,139,68.85,2.4,43.84,76.11,19.86,19.42,87.77,69.78,56.12,12.23,7.19,7.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.04,19.42,11.51,1.44,10.79,9.35,4.32,5.04,1.44,15.83,8.63,2.16,1.44,0.0,0.72,0.72,15.11,0.0,15.11,4.32,0.72,2.88,1.44,2.16,2.88,0.0,6.47,5.04,1.44,3.6,3.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.35,8.63,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.88,0.0,0.0,2.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,6.47,5.04,0.0,0.72,2.16,0.72,0.0,1.44,2.88,6.47,4.32,1.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.95,5.76,1.44,0.0,0.0,1.44,4.32,0
"WOW!! Another passionate, loving and emotional book from Mara White!! I had the great pleasure of reading an early copy of Maldeamores and I haven't stopped thinking about it. 
 Heed the warnings on this one because Maldeamores is unlike amy book I've read. Belen and Luciano are star-crossed lovers, fiercely in love but forced to deny their true feelings for each other. Like Mara's other books, I felt anxious, emotional, distraught and fascinated by these two characters and their tumultuous journey. The writing is stunning, sharp and incredibly erotic and the characters richly detailed. I was drawn into their world and was stunned by the turn of the events. These two are truly ""lovesick"" and simply cannot live apart from each other. 
 There are some very graphic and steamy scenes in this book, but they fit in with the story and add fuel to the deep emotional bond Belen and Luciano share. If you like to be challenged and thrilled when you read, then Maldeamores is the book for you. It is not an easy story but I loved the rollercoaster ride of emotions! Mara White is a talent to watch and I hope she will keep on writing these complex, sexy stories.

"4.5 stars!! I absolutely love this couple and the alternating POVs were perfection. 
 ""Why do you love me?"" he asks, his voice a whisper in my ear as I close my eyes. 
 ""Because you gave me the fairytale when I didn't believe in them."" 
 I LOVED The Resistance and couldn't wait to read the continuation of Holli and Dalton's story! While the first book in the series gave these two a happy ending, The Reckoning dives into ""real life"" issues, with Holli and Dalton learning how to live in their new roles and deal with her career and his skyrocketing fame as a rock star. 
 This book has a great story, strong characters and very steamy sex. There's also a new character that I loved to hate! Dalton is still dealing with the loss of his best friend and the fact that absolutely nothing that he does is private. His life has become an open book. It is also hard to know who to trust, and combined with Holli's busy schedule, these two have some tough times ahead. 
 ""... every dark day is worth the hundred light ones..."" 
 The Resistance was a total surprise for me and I loved that everything with these characters is not all happiness and light. Holli and Dalton love each other but they both struggle with trust issues, jobs, and the pressures of a long-distance relationship. Dalton might be a famous rock star but Holli also has her own pressures to deal with because of her new logo and brand, which has now become a household name. Add to that the fact that she is now doing photo shoots with a sexy male model and Dalton becomes insanely jealous. 
 Will these two overcome the pressures of their crazy lifestyles? Can Dalton be happy with married life? Relationships involved compromise and sacrifice and I loved how this story played out. The Reckoning is a great story with some angst, great characters and hot sex.

"4.5 - 5 Stars!! Another unexpected and fresh story from CD Reiss. 
 Shuttergirl is a bittersweet, second-chance love story that is at once sweet and poignant and gritty as well. The City of Los Angeles is as much of a main character here as Laine and Michael and adds a dark and gloomy undercurrent to the themes of the book. CD Reiss' City of Angels is not the shiny, glamourous world we might see on TV or in the moves or glossy magazines, but instead is a gloomy city of darkness beneath all the glitter, populated by scores of paparazzi all trying to land their next big payday off of the next big celebrity. 
 This story fascinated me on many different levels. Our hero and heroine Michael and Laine are from different worlds, whose paths crossed for a brief time in high school. She was the scruffy foster child and he was the Golden Boy, the son of Hollywood royalty. She had known incredible pain and suffering in her short life and he was raised in the privilged world of Hollywood. Laine was a tough-as-nails street child who hid a sensitive heart. And now, years later, their paths cross again. Only this time, she is a member of the reviled pack of paparazzi who stalk the every move of Hollywood's golden elite. 
 He looked over his shoulder at me. ""Shuttergirl."" I stepped forward, putting my hands on the railing. ""Is that the only name you know me by?"" ""It's the name I can repeat in company."" 
 Michael has lived his life according to plan and just once, aches to break out of the public persona that has been created for him: 
 My life had been written at birth, a list of opportunities read out loud to the world. Beginning, middle, and end. I had found security in that room to make decisions, yet the safety of limits. Laine had come and folded the paper, creasing my expectations in high school with her life story. Now, with her breath on my shoulder, she folded my life into an airplane and shot it out the window. The writing was the same, but the choices had changed, become wider and yet more limited. I'd gone from fake to real. From painting to sculpture. From acting as if I was living to actually being alive. 
 Laine has lived a hard life and the details of her childhood were heartbreaking. But she is whip-smart and strong and savyy and has made a name for herself as one of the best paparrazi around. But she holds no illusions as to how the paparazzi are thought of. And she doens't think she is good enough for Michael. But he is persistent and lonely and still aches for his first true love. Slowly, Laine allows herself to feel something real and geniuine for this gorgeous movie star, who suprisingly, is actually a very decent guy. 
 ""He was wearing me down, layer by layer, like a heat gun peeling off coats of paint and toxic lead whitewash to the bare wood. 
 I was fascinated by this tale of the darker side of Hollywood stardom and was immediately drawn in by the author's crisp, clean writing style. Shuttergirl is a refreshingly different take on a second-chance love story and I highly recommend this fast-paced, sometimes heartbreaking but always swoony story.",23,5,1,559,76.62,53.95,29.83,47.36,15.97,17.53,85.69,67.62,53.13,10.91,8.59,2.86,0.36,0.18,4.11,0.36,2.33,14.85,8.23,1.07,14.85,7.16,3.94,7.69,0.36,13.06,9.12,3.58,2.68,0.54,1.25,1.07,9.66,1.25,8.41,1.79,1.07,0.89,1.43,0.72,2.86,0.0,6.8,4.29,2.5,2.5,0.72,1.79,0.0,0.0,1.07,0.0,12.7,3.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,1.61,7.87,0.18,0.0,2.68,2.15,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.18,2.86,0.54,0.36,1.43,0.36,0.18,2.33,0.89,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.18,0.0,0.54,0.72,0.54,7.16,12.7,0.36,1.79,7.16,1.79,0.18,1.43,3.76,5.37,4.47,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.21,6.08,4.83,0.18,0.36,1.07,2.68,0

 It is such a pleasure to read anything that Skye Warren writes! Blake and Erin are one of my favorite couples and this epilogue is a sensual, dramatic and very satisfying conclusion to their story. I absolutely love the Beauty series and I am very sad to see this couple's story come to an end. Blake is, just, um, no words - brilliant, brave, broken, strong AND sensitive, all rolled into one HOT Alpha male. The sex scenes in this series are among the hottest I have ever read.

"3.5 Stars! 
 Parallel universes? Yes, please! I have always been intrigued with stories about the path not taken. The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies, Sliding Doors. While this book was not all that I had hoped for, it is nonetheless a well-written, thought-provoking story about the consequences of our actions, fate and destiny. 
 Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there, and that our choices lead us to our own realities. Both parallel stories in this book were engaging, REAL, and very original. The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others. 
 ""I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else, led me to someone else. And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didn't end up with you."" 
 Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths, as does her best friend Gabby. I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book, which, happily, was replaced by joy by the end. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book, which will make you think about your choices in life, and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives. Is everything all mapped out, occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be? There's lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. 
 I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book. However, much of this story seems aimed at twenty-somethings who will very much enjoy Hannah's journey. I did feel that some important details were missing, but overall, both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh. 
 I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the author's other books now.

"5 Sexy and Edgy Stars!! 
 ""Even the best of us isn't purely good. And even the worst of us isn't purely evil."" 
 This book is pure PERFECTION. My thought when finishing was, ""Now what do I read?!"" This is one of my top favorite series EVER. I am truly obsessed with this author and this story. Jonah and Vivienne are incredibly written characters, filled with depth and raw emotion. This is a very adult story, dealing with very adult subjects. With that said, these book are among the most highly erotic stories I have ever read. 
 This series is not for everyone, but if you like sexy, edgy, mature stories, then definitely give these books a try. Lilah Pace's writing captivated me and drew me into Jonah and Vivienne's story like very few authors can do. While the subject may seem very taboo, I found these books to be as much an exploration of women's sexuality as they are ""forbidden"" erotic romance. These stories take you on an emotional journey that is sensual, enthralling and addictive, to say the least. 
 BEGGING FOR IT is the conclusion to the series and picks up right where the first book ended. They must be read in order. These two characters are absolutely unforgettable, and I could not really fathom how they were going to make their very unorthodox relationship work. Jonah struggles with his own seemingly-insurmountable dark fantasies, while Vivienne also struggles to come to terms with her own deep-seated fears, as well as her very dysfunctional family. I literally raced through this book, fearful that the author was not going to give these two perfectly damaged souls the conclusion they were worthy of. I felt tremendous empathy for both of these characters and was deeply satisfied with the fantastic conclusion to their stories. I can't say enough about these books. They are thought-provoking, emotional and incredibly readable. 
 ""We don't get better; we don't fix everything that's broken. We just learn how to work around the broken bits. How to do the best we can with what we have, and who we are."" 
 I am completely OBSESSED with this author and cannot wait for whatever books she might have planned for the future. I hope there are more books under the name Lilah Pace - I will read anything she writes!

"WOW!! I don't even know where to begin with this book. Lilah Pace has written an absolutely perfect story, filled with erotic moments, thrills, emotion and a gripping plot. Each and every character is perfectly drawn, richly detailed and essential to the story. I can't say enough about this book and the author stalking has already begun. Who is this Lilah Pace and why has she enthralled me so? 
 Vivienne is an art student at the University of Texas - Austin who has rape fantasies but they are rooted in a traumatic past event, and the many sessions with her therapist bring the story to light and perfectly frame the rest of the book. While some readers might be turned off by this story, I found it to be sexy, dramatic and addictive. She meets Dr. Jonah Marks, a gorgeous, brilliant and enigmatic professor in another department at UT, and through a series of very thrilling events, they begin a series of encounters. Certainly ""relationship"" might be too strong a word for what they do. But I can guarantee that you have never read scenes as hot as the scenes between Jonah and Vivi. 
 ""How did this man with the power to terrify me also become the one person who truly makes me feel safe?"" 
 They do reach a certain level of intimacy which is very beautiful and poignant all at once. Both Jonah and Vivi are richly written characters, very damaged for sure. There is nothing superficial about anything in this book and I was also absolutely entranced by the detail with which the author described the various settings in the book. From Austin to New Orleans, there is a level and richness of detail here that is greatly appreciated by this reader. 
 ""Jonah doesn't know me well enough to know that I'm always ready to protect myself. My guard is always up. Still, I like that he always considers my safety even in the maddened heat of our mutual fever."" 
 I highlighted a zillion passages in this book and I can't possibly include them all here. Asking for It blew me away and is without a doubt one of my top reads of the year. Run, don't walk, to read this book. Don't let the blurb scare you away, there is so much more to this book and I need the next book NOW!!!

"This series captivated me and worked its magic on me and I absolutely did not want to see it end!! The Traveling Woman is the second part of a two part series. The Traveling Man is the first book must be read before this one. 
 ""Real life"" has now taken hold of Kes and Aimee and the question becomes, can Kes be truly happy and satisfied living in one place for a long period of time? He is a carnie, it is in his blood, and Aimee realizes that once they have spent time together in her home. These two truly love each other, and neither one wants the other to sacrifice their dreams for the other. 
 ""I'd always thought of him as my personal sun, feeling warmed just by being near him--that hadn't changed. I knew that I was still in love with Kes--that hadn't changed either, but it didn't mean that we were right for each other."" 
 Aimee knows that Kes has the wanderlust in him and that he will never be truly at home in her world. He settles in but grows restless and bored and she knows he is beginning to feel caged in. 
 ""His happiness made me wistful. He was at home here--this was his world. I could see him watching the carnies and performers with a deep longing plain on his face. Kes needed to create magic and he couldn't do it in my world. In my calm, ordered, routine life, Kes was a kingfisher among a flock of pigeons."" 
 This book is filled with beautiful writing, heartbreaking events and relationships that will be broken and healed again. I cannot recommend this brilliant series highly enough! Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen with Aimee and Kes, the author took me on a surprising, breathtaking journey, one which I did not want to end. If you are looking for writing with real depth and substance, then I highly recommend The Traveling Duet. Aimee and Kes will thrill you and entrance you all at the same time. One of my favorite series ever!!

"YAY!! A book about ADULTS, I love it!! Accidental Alpha is Allison and Wade's story. It can definitely be read as a standalone but it is recommended your read A is for Alpha Male, the first book in the series. The prologue punched me in the gut and I couldn't even imagine where this story would go! But the author treats the serious subject with humor, grace and lots of Alpha steam! And Alison, I loved her and all of her insecurities!! 
 ""I'm more wine than grape,"" she declared suddenly, bringing my hands to a stop mid- squeeze. 
 I was thrilled that Wade was there for Allison and he was all man, all the time, and he acted with honesty and truth right up front. I loved the dual POV which kept this book moving along at a really fast pace. I read this in one sitting and really enjoyed it! And Wade, I'd love more heroes just like him! Funny, sexy, protective, he's the whole package. 
 ""Was she wearing a bra? It didn't look like she was wearing a bra. No joke, if I'd ever doubted it before, there was no question now. I was a boob man. An Allison's boobs man. Roll tongue back in mouth. Do it now."" 
 Allison was reluctant to get involved with Wade but hey, she's not immune to the Tim McGraw-lookalike. And his humor and gentleness combined won her over. There's lot of funny scenes and dialogue in this book which balanced out the serious undertones. 
 I'd known he was attractive. God, I'd made a fool of myself the first time I'd noticed just how much so. And arguably, also the second. But this time was different. This time he looked real. He looked like a full- grown man-- far away from old but way the hell past boy. He didn't look like an imitation of Tim McGraw, surrounded by the allure of being a celebrity. He looked like Wade. And he looked dangerously tempting. Ah, crap. 
 Accidental Alpha is an enjoyable, quick read filled with the some fantastic characters. There's sexy times mixed right in with the great dialogue, heavy subject matter and just the right amount of emotion. It looks like the next one to have his own story will be Hunter - after what happens in Accidental Alpha, I'm looking forward to his book!",6,4,1,393,46.98,31.52,18.75,91.14,10.92,14.76,88.3,70.48,55.47,14.25,9.67,4.33,0.0,0.25,5.09,0.0,4.58,16.28,8.4,1.27,11.45,9.16,5.34,7.12,1.53,16.28,7.63,5.09,1.02,0.0,0.25,0.76,10.43,1.53,8.91,1.27,0.51,2.29,0.76,1.02,3.31,0.0,7.38,5.85,0.76,3.31,2.8,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.51,12.72,5.09,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.51,2.04,7.89,0.0,0.0,1.78,4.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.29,0.51,0.0,1.27,0.0,0.51,3.05,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,1.02,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.25,0.0,0.51,0.0,0.25,0.76,0.0,8.14,10.94,0.76,1.27,7.12,2.04,0.0,0.51,3.31,7.12,3.82,0.25,1.02,0.51,0.25,0.25,0.0,22.14,6.87,5.6,0.25,2.8,4.07,2.54,0
"loved this book! Sarina Bowen is a new author to me and this is the first book I have read in the Ivy Years Series. It is a standalone but now I am a huge fan so I plan to read the other books in this series. 
 Bella is a strong heroine and Rafe is totally swoon worthy. In this story, he is the virginal one and Bella is the one who enjoys sex and is not afraid to be the bold one. Hpw refreshing! The Shameless Hour is funny, sexy and heartbreaking all at once. Sarina takes some serious themes and incorporates them seamlessly into her story but gives her characters a fantastic HEA. 
 Rafe is a hot soccer player who catches Bella's eye but who is inexperienced with women. He is a hard-working student from a close-knit family, quite the opposite of Bella. He is a wonderful character who is honest, trustworthy and gorgeous. But he doesn't just want a one-night stand with Bella. 
 ""Bella's enthusiasm had obliterated all of my caution. She wanted me. And I could no longer think of any reason why I couldn't have this."" 
 Bella is a surprisingly strong and funny heroine who is not afraid to be herself and is unapologetic about her sexuality. She is funny and sexy and I absolutely loved her! Sarina Bowen writes a memorable female character who has grit, backbone and smarts. She is wildly attracted to Rafe but refuses to have a relationship with him because, well, she just doesn't do relationships. But Rafe is persistent and these two build a solid friendship along with their very explosive chemistry. Will Rafe convince Bella that he is worth the risk? Will Bella be able to overcome the reputation that seems to follow her around school? Read The Shameless Hour, you will love the funny dialogue, great story and strong characters that Sarina Bowen has created. 
 ""All good things are risky""... 
 I already miss Rafe and Bella! And now I must read the other books in The Ivy Years because I need more of these stories!

"4.5 Stars!! John Logan. *sigh* Absolutely adored this book!! 
 The Deal was a total surprise for me and was one of my favorite books of 2015 so far. It was fresh, sexy, smart and funny and I was soooo excited when I heard Elle Kennedy was writing a story about John Logan! I have been immersed in college romances lately, and The Mistake is now another one of my favorites in this genre. 
 Sure, not every college or college experience is like the setting of this story, but I adored the characters and their friends (well, excerpt for one) and their struggles to find themselves in what to me is also a great coming of age story. 
 John Logan is absolutely Book Boyfriend material! Swoon!! I fell in love with him as he tried to win Grace over. Ms. Kennedy's writing style is sexy, fast-paced, heartwarming and very funny, and this book was like unwrapping a delicious treat. I loved reading about the characters' backstories and loved the fabulous ending to this book. 
 The Mistake was a flirty, steamy and fast read and I am now an even bigger fan of Elle Kennedy's writing. I loved this book and I think everyone at some point in their life has experienced some if not all of the emotions that these characters experienced. The Mistake is another winner from Elle Kennedy!

"Well this is a book that has some controversy surrounding it, of which I was blissfully unaware until I read a warning that came with this ARC. There are lots of reviewers who refuse to read this book, and that's fine. But based on its merits, I enjoyed this MM romance that comes with a healthy dose of sarcasm. 
 Black Balled is a fairly quick read and is a parody of the indie book world, pairing a snarky book reviewer with tons of anxieties with an author who has tons of anger issues. The authors did a great job at the dual POV and really, when you peel away the layers of sarcasm and humor, the story is about finding yourself. 
 ""Larson knows who he is and he makes no excuses or apologies for it. He wears his flaws just as proudly as he does his attributes, for all to see, and for everyone to accept or reject-as the case may be because it makes no difference to him. He is comfortable in his own skin. That is probably because Larson is genuine. He doesn't wear layers of facades that need to be ripped away in order to find his inner soul; or his truth. He just puts it all out there without reservation. 
 Not like me."" 
 There is lots and lots of white-hot sex in this book and tons of great banter. If you go into Black Balled knowing it has a very different storyline, and that both characters have a wicked sense of humor, then you'll love this book!",9,4,1,261,39.92,62.76,11.47,49.53,18.64,14.18,90.04,75.1,61.3,17.24,9.2,1.53,0.0,1.53,4.98,0.0,8.05,16.86,6.13,0.0,14.94,8.81,5.36,8.05,1.53,15.33,4.98,4.98,3.45,0.77,0.77,1.92,13.41,1.92,11.49,2.68,2.68,0.38,2.68,0.38,3.83,0.0,8.05,4.98,3.07,2.68,1.92,0.77,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,12.64,3.45,0.77,0.38,0.77,0.77,1.15,9.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.83,0.0,0.0,3.45,0.0,0.38,1.53,0.77,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,4.6,9.2,0.77,1.53,5.75,1.15,0.0,0.38,1.53,2.3,8.43,0.77,0.77,0.38,0.0,0.38,0.0,12.26,4.98,3.83,0.0,0.38,1.15,1.92,0
"I love Chelle Bliss and was so excited to read her newest series! If you've read Men of Inked, then you will fall head over heels in love with Morgan (NICE NAME!!) DeLuca, a Gallo cousin and Alpha male extraordinaire. He is just out of the Army and looking for direction in life when he gets an offer from his Florida cousins to join the ALFA PI agency. He picks up and leaves Chicago and his meddling mother to start over again with a new job. 
 I loved how the Gallo family is woven into this story. If you haven't read Chelle's Men of Ink series, you are missing out! They are filled with love, big families, snappy banter and lots and lots of mind-blowing sexy times. Get right on that! 
 Sinful Intent is a fast-paced, steamy story involving Morgan's first job, investigating and protecting his first client, Race True, from harassing and threatening emails that have escalated. She is being blackmailed and he must find her tormenter. She is a buttoned-up, straight-laced corporate type, sexy but basically married to her job and she needs someone like Morgan in her life to add the spontaneity she has been sorely missing out on. 
 Chelle's books are steamy, entertaining and have some of the most creative sex scenes I have ever read. Morgan is just, WOW. Race and Morgan together are just explosive. I liked the suspense and mystery along with the funny moments sprinkled throughout the book. I really enjoyed this book. It is overall a very enjoyable, sexy story and a great start to a new series by one of my favorite authors.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Andi is a feisty race car mechanic, working in a man's world but holding her own with everyone with her sharp sense of humor, that is, until she meets Carrick Ryan. He is everything she has stayed away from her whole life, gorgeous, sexy, a player, and worst of all, a race car driver. 
 ""How can I hate and love this sport in equal measure?"" 
 For reason of her own, Andi refuses to become involved with race car drivers, and to make matters more complicated, Carrick is her BOSS! She has seen the evidence of his past affairs on his team and holds back her true feelings. But Carrick does't give up and their chemistry is undeniable. 
 ""You do distract me. You're a bad. . . bad distraction, Andressa."" He runs his tongue up my neck to my ear. He nips my earlobe with his teeth, making me shiver. ""I'm bad, huh?"" ""Mmhmm. . .you're really, really bad."" 
 What could have been a predictable, formulaic story turns into a sexy, hot, very readable book that I devoured in almost one sitting. Carrick - WOW!! Loved him. And I loved how the author made her heroine actually have a backbone, a sense of humor and smarts in addition to her beauty and talent with cars. A female mechanic? I love it! Revved is why I read contemporary romance, it is hot, has lots of humor and great supporting characters in addition to the wonderful story and exotic locales. And Carrick and Andi almost burn right through the pages! I love Samantha Towle's writing and I highly recommend REVVED for all fans of hot Alphas and feisty heroines.",8,4,1,274,51.52,75.28,2.14,66.25,11.42,17.52,81.75,64.6,49.64,16.06,13.14,4.74,0.0,1.09,6.93,0.36,2.92,13.87,5.11,0.73,11.68,6.93,3.65,6.2,0.0,12.41,7.66,3.65,3.28,0.73,1.09,1.46,11.31,1.46,9.85,2.92,2.55,0.73,0.73,1.46,1.09,0.0,8.39,5.47,2.55,4.38,2.19,1.82,0.0,0.36,0.0,0.0,15.33,5.11,0.36,0.0,0.36,0.73,1.09,10.95,0.0,0.0,5.11,3.28,2.19,0.0,0.0,2.19,1.46,0.36,0.0,1.09,0.0,0.0,2.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36,3.65,9.12,0.73,0.73,4.38,0.36,0.36,2.55,0.73,2.55,6.2,0.36,1.09,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.36,24.45,7.66,7.66,1.09,2.55,2.19,3.28,0

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Ella Frank has written another sexy, gripping and character-driven book with TRUST! Are you new to the M/M genre? Then I highly recommend this series because the story is really about two people loving each other and fighting the same battles with family, work and external forces as everyone else. Oh, and there's some super-steamy sexy times to thrill you as well!! 
 Logan and Tate have both changed and grown in this fantastic series. 
 ""His motto of ""try, take, and top"" had changed. Oh, he'd tried Tate all right, and they'd both done a helluva lot of taking, but for once in his life, Logan didn't feel the desire to win. He didn't need to come out on top. What he wanted was Tate's trust--his absolute trust."" 
 Logan and Tate have made great strides in their relationship but Tate is still holding back. He and Logan are in love, yes, but is that always enough to sustain a long, happy and healthy relationship? Ella Tate's wonderful writing style kept the story flowing until the end, and there are some dramatic surprises in store for our gorgeous heroes which kept my heart racing until the very end! 
 Once the calm after the storm had settled, Logan moved up his body, and Tate wrapped his arms around him. As they both lay there, in the silence of the room, neither one of them said a word-- because, really, there was nothing to add to such perfection. 
 I highly recommend this series to all fans of contemporary romance. The story is enthralling and the characters memorable. And I absolutely adored the wonderful and satisfying ending for the sexy Logan and Tate. 
 ""No,"" Logan finally said, and Tate felt his heart sink. ""I'll never see you that way again. Because before this, I didn't know you were essential for me to feel alive.""",11,4,1,313,40.27,45.72,46.02,98.97,14.9,15.02,87.86,71.57,54.63,11.82,8.63,2.24,0.32,1.28,3.51,1.28,3.19,16.61,5.75,1.6,12.14,7.35,6.07,10.22,2.24,15.97,7.67,6.07,4.47,2.24,1.6,0.64,12.78,2.56,9.9,1.28,2.24,1.28,0.0,1.28,3.83,0.32,9.27,7.99,0.64,3.51,2.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.42,5.75,0.32,0.0,0.64,0.32,2.56,7.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.28,0.0,0.32,0.64,0.32,0.0,2.88,0.64,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.64,0.64,0.64,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.32,7.03,11.18,0.64,1.92,7.35,0.32,0.32,1.28,5.75,7.67,3.51,0.32,1.28,0.0,0.64,0.64,0.0,22.36,5.11,7.03,0.64,1.92,2.88,4.79,0
"""I kept my eyes closed. I couldn't bear for him to see what mine must look like. Desperate. Yearning. Drowning in agony."" 
 Yearning and desperation. Two feelings perfectly conveyed by the author in Deep Blue Eternity. I can't stop thinking about this book! A beautifully written, haunting story of two very lost souls, Natasha Boyd also injects some much-needed humor and a whole lot of sexy into this magnificent book. 
 Livvy has run away to her grandmother's old island cottage and is quite shocked to find a caretaker named Tom living there. They begin a tentative and uneasy living situation but of course there is much more than meets the eye here. They are both frightened in their own way, both trying to escape brutal and heartbreaking pasts off the coast of South Carolina. Both are harbouring some very, very sad secrets and both are seeking healing, maybe in each others' arms. But Tom pushes Livvy away, she is very young and he cannot tell her why he is keeping her at a distance. 
 ""I mean, I thought we had a... a friendship or something, and I don't understand what I've done wrong."" Addressing it made a weird emotional bubble grow in my chest, and my eyes started to sting. 
 Livvy tries to begin a new life by finding a job at a local cafe and befriending the residents. But Tom battles his true feelings for her and settles on a friendship, as well as protecting her from the local bad boys. 
 ""Lifting my arms tentatively, I slid them around his waist. I thought I felt him shudder. His muscles were bunched tight, or he was tense. I didn't know. He was hugging me. I could hug him back, right?"" 
 This book tackles some highly sensitive subjects which are handled with great care and sensitivity by Ms. Boyd. This is a moody, sexy, very emotional story that is perfectly written and entrancing. Do not miss Deep Blue Eternity! It is one of my favorite reads so far this year.",10,5,1,339,35.29,28.68,38.56,20.23,11.69,19.47,91.74,74.34,53.69,15.63,11.8,5.6,0.29,0.0,4.72,1.18,3.83,15.34,5.31,0.88,10.62,7.67,5.6,6.78,1.77,18.58,10.32,4.72,3.83,2.06,1.18,0.59,12.98,0.0,12.68,2.95,0.59,2.36,2.06,1.18,3.54,0.0,10.91,5.01,5.01,3.54,0.0,2.65,0.59,0.0,0.59,0.0,13.27,5.31,1.18,0.29,0.59,0.29,1.77,8.55,0.29,0.88,2.36,3.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.36,0.29,0.59,1.18,0.0,0.29,4.42,0.29,0.0,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0.88,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.29,3.54,13.57,0.59,1.47,7.37,2.06,0.0,2.06,2.65,5.31,6.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.99,8.55,4.42,0.29,0.59,2.06,2.06,0
"4.5 Emotionally Stunning Stars!! 
 ""He was my truth. Even if that made me a sinner."" 
 I expect nothing less than total perfection from Penelope Ward and she delivers another very sexy, very emotionally satisfying story with Sins of Sevin. This book is the perfect cure for any kind of book slump you might be in. The characters are all richly written, the story is very different and creative, and the emotions this book inspires will have you wishing you there was more to this story. I did not want it to end! 
 Sins of Sevin, told in alternating POV's, is about a fundamentally Christian household where the daughters must be courted before marriage by a man who has been chosen by the family. No kissing, no touching no NOTHING before marriage. The problem is, that Sevin is promised to a girl he does not love. His heart belongs to another. There are many factors at play here as to why he cannot be with the one he loves, his true soul mate, and these obstacles only make Sevin to be an even stronger, heartbreaking hero than is already is. 
 ""You can't choose love. It chooses you, and once that happens, it doesn't let you go. You can pretend it's not there but when you try, it only fights harder...louder...until you finally get the message and give in."" 
 I do not read many other ""taboo"" romance books other than Penelope Ward. She is the Queen, bar none, of the forbidden romance genre. Sins of Sevin is another fantastic forbidden romance with a hero that I fell in love with from the first page. This book is filled with lots of anguish, emotion and plenty of guilt on the part of both main characters but the writing in this book flows so beautifully that even the most cynical reader with fall in love with Sevin (and MAYBE Evangeline!). 
 Ms. Ward's story spans several years in time, which adds to the richness of the story. I honestly could not tell where this story was going end up, and the ending truly did surprise me. And please, have plenty of tissues handy for the Epilogue to this beautifully sexy and very loving book. 
 ""I have so much love inside of me that's all yours, and it's been trapped inside. I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me. I know your heart belongs to me. But I'm selfish. I want all of you. I want you."" 
 Sevin and Evangeline are far from perfect. Both make choices that I did not agree with. But I absolutely fell in love with Sevin and with this story. Do not miss it. Sins of Sevin is a must-read!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Tate Morrow young, up-and-coming country-western singer who works as a UPS driver by day and singer in a small bar at night. Andy (from the Rock and Roll Series!) discovers Tate and brings him to Tennessee to begin his recording career. I absolutely loved Tate, he is a down-to-earth, average guy with huge talent who is literally thrown into the country music scene and tries to navigate his way among all the sharks. Tate is paired up with Audra to be his manager, and she immediately begins scheming to create a public persona for Tate. She sees big things in his future. She intends to mold him into star material and brings him to a stylist to have his clothes tailored and that is when he meets, Maisie, another up-and-comer who is a talented seamstress among the music-induistry insiders. 
 Tate knows that she is something special and likes her immediately. For Maisie, things aren't so easy, since she has had a painful past and finds it difficult to connect with anyone romantically. She lives a closed-off, sheltered personal life but dares to hope things might be different with Tate. 
 I absolutely loved the behind-the-scenes look in to the glittery world of country music, the tough times going on tour and the difficulties trusting the people around you are supposed to have your best interests at heart. This book is told in a delightfully fresh alternating POV which adds a perfect touch to this story. Tate is an honest, trusting and giving man and I loved watching his rise to stardom. He never waivers from his true self and never gives up on Maisie. 
 Tate and Maisie face tough times together as they face media scrutiny and at times I thought they would not be able to withstand the firestorm! But not to fear, they definitely get their HEA and also several characters get what's coming to them! Tate, like all of Ms. Stewart's books, is incredibly well-written and she spends time developing her characters. Tate is romantic and sweet, with just the right amount of steam. 
 If you are looking for a contemporary romance with lots of heart, you will love this one!

"We loved Mickey and Amelia's story! Soaring is classic Kristen Ashley, filled with love, family, a helluva sexy Alpha hero and lots more love. What is different about Soaring is that Amelia is far from perfect. She is a seriously flawed heroine who has made some very bad choices in her life. Those actions have had serious consequences including the loss of the custody of her children. But she is bound and determined to change her life, get her kids back and maybe, just maybe, fall in love again. 
 Ms. Ashley fills Amelia's house with good friends and lots of family. Fences are mended and hearts are repaired along the way. But it is not an easy path, as Amelia has alienated most of her family and must hide her shattered heart in order to put things right again. We absolutely loved how the author really nailed what it's like to live with teenagers, and loved the scenes with Amelia's kids and Mickey's kids as well. 
 Mickey has also had a rough past and resists falling for his gorgeous neighbor. He is a good man and might be one of our favorite KA heroes ever. Strong, sexy, low-key....yes, please!! And he accepts Amelia for who she is and doesn't judge her based on her past behavior. 
 ""The mistakes we make in life don't define us, Amy. The way we handle 'em after makin' 'em do."" 
 This is an EPIC love story. We ""soared"" right along with Amelia and Mickey. We also loved how Amelia finally, for the first time in her life, stands on her own two feet and stands up to her awful, low-life ex-husband Conrad. And she does so without harming her children along the way. 
 We love a strong heroine and Amelia turns out to be just that. Smart, beautiful and loving, it was a pleasure reading about a heroine who was over 40 and had LIVED a life. Soaring is a gritty, sexy, beautiful story. Don't miss this one!! 
 ""Life isn't always beauty,"" he returned. ""Most of the time it's shit. But you keep fightin' to turn it around, that says it all about you. And you're fightin'.

"Misconduct is one of my favorite books of the year!! Sexy, engaging, intelligent and inventive, Misconduct is why I read contemporary romance. There are very few books I would read twice and Misconduct is one of them. 
 I want to thank Ms. Douglas for writing an exciting, very adult contemporary romance that hits all the high notes. Misconduct was a pure pleasure to read, from the well-drawn characters, to the New Orleans setting, to the damaged family relationships that were the center of this book. This book is one of my top favorites of the year, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. 
 If you like to get lost in a book, then Misconduct is for you. The sexy, sultry New Orleans setting; the smart, successful, handsome, yet damaged hero; the beautiful but skittish heroine, all of these add up to an unputdownable story. This book is very different from the Fall Away series except for the unparalleled writing. This story is for adults, it is erotic, sexy, poignant, exciting and thrilling. What more could you ask for in a book? 
 Tyler and Easton are two of the standout main characters that I have read this year. And I have read a LOT. I read an early paperback copy so I dog-eared almost every single page of my copy!! Here's a peek: 
 ""I should go home. 
 But he kept wanting me. 
 He kept tapping at my shell like I was an egg he needed to crack. And while I constantly felt like goo that would spill everywhere if not protected by my hard outer armor, he made me feel like I didn't need it."" 
 Exceptional writing; an exciting, fast-paced story; all the right emotions ... this book has it all. And THE most important factor for me when reading is a connection to the main characters. I felt a deep connection not only with Tyler and Easton, but felt THEIR connection and their love. 
 Put Misconduct on your must-read list. It is an outstanding story!

"I don't think there's been a book by Cardeno C. that I have not loved. Home Again is another sexy and sweet story where family is first, the characters get their HEA, and the sex is SMOKING hot. This book is told is a series of flashbacks which alternate with present day, focusing on Noah and Clark, who first meet when they are teenagers. I love how this author spotlights the importance of friends who accept you, but also being true to yourself. There is some angst in this book but you just know the main characters will work everything out. The story is clever and the alternating POV's are refreshing. Oh and of course, the chemistry between Noah and Clark is off-the-charts hot and the sex scenes are absolutely amazing. Loved the twist at the end! This is a standalone although it is part of a series. If you are looking for sexy-sweet M/M romance, then Cardeno C. is your go-to author and you will love Home Again.

"I do LOVE my Katy Evans books!! MANWHORE +1 was a wonderful and very satisfying sequel to the first book in the series, Manwhore! I loved the very modern and witty yet very sexy story. 
 This book picks up right after the conclusion to MANWHORE. Rachel has publicly embarrassed her boyfriend Malcolm Saint and is in deep despair of ever repairing their relationship. Katy Evans writes a beautifully flowing yet very fast-paced and verrrrry sexy story here as we experience the deep heartache that Rachel feels. 
 ""This is what I've been waiting for, for four weeks. This is what I wanted when I left a thousand messages on his phones and what I wanted when I wrote a thousand others that I left unsent. To see him. 
 For him to want to see me."" 
 There's plenty of office drama, too, as Rachel's dream job seems to be in jeopardy due to a bidding war over the ownership of the company where she works. One of the things I love about this author is that her heroes, no matter how tortured, always have the ability the love deeply and Saint is no exception. Despite his reputation, he really cares deeply for Rachel and their scenes together are perfect. 
 I definitely recommend this series if you love a contemporary, witty, and passionate story with a great cast of supporting players. I also loved that there might be another story here for Gina and Tahoe? Things seem to be pointing in that direction and I would love to read more about them! I can't wait to see what's next for Rachel and Saint and am anxiously awaiting Ms. Manwhore!

"4.5 STARS!! 
 ""Dragging my hand over my face, I pull my phone back out and try to focus on the man I need to beat. 
 And I think of that nice girl who doesn't want to be nice. A girl who wants to be unforgettable and doesn't realize, she already is."" 
 MAVERICK!!!! I think I'm in LOVE. Katy Evans has created a gorgeous, sensitive beast of a man. Another legend is born. 
 Legend is the kind of Katy Evans book that I love, filled with passion, emotion, tons of sexy times and a deep emotional connection between the two main characters. This book goes back to the roots of the series, an lonely underdog fighting against the world, and a sweet, kind woman who is swept away by his passion. 
 Maverick ""the Avenger"" Cage is an outcast in the underground fighting world. But he knows he can be the best if only someone would give him a chance and train with him. The best he can do is a down-and-out trainer named Oz. Reese is Remy's wife Brooke's cousin, and is traveling with them on the fighting circuit while taking care of their son, Racer. She is a loner, shy, and never thinks someone like Maverick would be interested in her. 
 ""I wanted to be understood, and I wanted to be known. And I wanted to be loved."" 
 I LOVE a good underdog story and Legend fits the bill perfectly. There are no over-the-top characters here, just two people who are searching for something that they never had. And when Maverick and Reese get together, WOW!!!! Hello, new favorite book boyfriend!! 
 ""Don't go after her if you don't think you can deserve her."" He hits me again and I block, then jab him. He eases back and prowls around. So do I. 
 ""Deserve her first. Then go after her."" 
 Reese and Maverick have a forbidden romance at first, because Maverick is in training to ultimately fight Remington ""Riptide"" Tate and challenge him for the championship. And nothing will stand in his way. But the truth comes out and Reese must decide whose corner she is really in. There's no question that Maverick is all hers, and he is the kind of man that knows when he has found the woman for him. I loved that Reese is not perfect, and the author makes sure to point out her insecurities. This is the kind of book that Katy Evans does best, filled with fierce warmth, hotness and a brute of a hero with a heart of gold. Maverick is EVERYTHING. I adored Legend and it is the perfect entry in the REAL series of books.

"Reclaimed is a sexy, romantic, gritty and very real love story from River Savage. As a fan of her earlier books, I couldn't wait to see what she had in store for Nix and Kadence. The story starts off with a beautiful and H-O-T scene between the two characters and then, when their lives should have been fulfilling and beautiful, events take a turn into some very dark territory. I applaud Ms. Savage for tackling a very serious topic with great sensitivity, imagination and yes. even a little humor. 
 There are lots of spoilers in this story so I won't be too detailed here but if you are a fan of the first two books in this series, do not miss Reclaimed! Nix is as hot as ever and the dialogue in this book crackles off the page. The author did a wonderful job of conveying Kadence's pain and her struggles to deal with her issues. 
 ""I don't know what is happening to me. Spending my days tired, angry and in tears has become my normal. Low is everything I asked for, everything I need. So why does it feel like I have made a mistake?"" 
 I loved how Nix gives Kadence the space and time that she needs, but when he decides to romance his woman, WHOA!! The author doesn't hold back! I loved this novella and it was the perfect Valentine to all fans of this series. Enjoy!

"4.5 - 5 stars!! This book took me by surprise. Loved the story and the writing! Gorgeous and heartfelt and sexy and a little angsty. I highly recommend this book to all fans of second-chance romance and military stories. I immediately connected with these characters and literally read this story in one sitting. 
 The author had my heart racing as I read Alex and West's story. As teenagers, Alex was firmly ""friend-zoned"" with West, a place she most certainly did not want to be. But she couldn't figure out how to get out of the friend zone and get him to really see her and reciprocate the feelings she had for him. 
 With one ""ill-advised comment,"" Alex's irritation with her dad transferred to West. ""His admiration and respect for my dad equals one thing for me-- a one-way ticket to Friend City as far as he's concerned."" 
 Then just like that, West was gone, and Alex lost touch with him for years. She went off to school, and despite their connection and deep feelings toward each other, West does not contact her after being deployed overseas. It comes as a total shock when Alex finds West again. It seems he wants absolutely nothing to do with her. He is a changed man in many ways. But Alex knows what they had is special and she refuses to give up on him. Her heart literally breaks for West and the struggles he faces after returning from deployment. 
 ""I'm so fucking tired of running to stand still. I still have a lot of issues to work through, but I'm trying like hell. Please be patient with me, Poppy."" He squeezes my waist firmly and keeps his eyes closed. 
 Will West be able to live again among his family and friends? Will he let Alex love him and accept him for who and what he is? I absolutely the way the author dealt with the issues of returning servicemen and loved this story. It is sweet, emotional, tender, sexy and even a little funny, along with the drama. I love this author's writing style and look forward to reading more of her books!

"4.5 sexy-Alpha stars!! 
 Harper Sloan keeps getting better and better! I loved this book! The author has created more characters to fall in love with. Cohen and Dani are absolutely irresistible and their story was steamy, emotional, passionate and beautiful. This story has the perfect blend of sexy, heart-warming, funny and tension. I read this book in one sitting and really feel that it is one of Harper's best books. 
 Dani is a sweet girl and knows from an early age that Cohen is her man. The problem is her overprotective Alpha father kept her almost locked away and she never thought that Cohen saw her as anything but the best friend's little sister. I loved that she really was honest with Cohen, she didn't try and hide her feelings. That was a refreshing twist for me. 
 Cohen is another gorgeous, sexy Alpha as only Harper Sloan can create. He is brave, loving and will do anything to protect his girl. He never forgot Dani or gave up on them, even when he was in the middle of combat. 
 ""Right in the middle of that Hell-on-earth chaos, I would hear her words trail through my thoughts right when I needed an extra push of strength or, God forbid, hope. I think that was the moment that I realized the enormity of it and that confession whispered all those years ago. Right or wrong, whatever it is between us would always be bigger than I understand. It's something that was so unexpected-- that feeling, craving, desire, to make her mine. It's something I've almost felt guilty about over the years."" 
 Unexpected Fate is a thrilling, totally sexy story filled with family, love and emotion. I highly recommend it for all fans of Harper Sloan and for anyone who loves a fast-paced, steamy story. This story has a fabulous and satisfying ending and I can't wait for more books in this series!

"4.5 - 5 Sexy - Sweet Stars!! 
 Hello, Elle Kennedy! Thank you for this perfect blend of sexy, sweet and funny! The Deal is a palate cleanser, the kind of book that is a refreshing change of pace from dark, angsty, over-emotional stories. Even if you are not usually a fan of college romances, take a chance on The Deal, you won't be disappointed. Hannah is a smart, hard-working, self-sufficient music major, talented and unfortunately very closed off to any sort of interpersonal relationships. Garrett is a hockey player (Hello!! New favorite sport!), and a ""player"" in every other sense of the word. He is required to maintain a certain GPA to play on the team and for this, he needs a top-notch tutor for one of his classes. Enter Hannah. Excerpt that she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with Garrett. 
 There is so much more to Garrett than meets the eye. I loved how he slowly breaks down Hannah's resistance and she discovers, to her total surprise, that he is actually an incredibly decent and yes, very irresistible guy. The Deal is a wonderfully layered story, with the characters getting to know one another and slowly developing a bond. There are no contrived situations here or over-the-top plot developments. The story is pure gold and I absolutely loved every single word of it! (There was only one ""oops"" moment in this story which hopefully won't reappear in The Mistake - American college students don't use ""meters"" to describe measurements - they would use feet.) 
 There are also fabulous supporting characters here and I can't wait for their stories. Elle Kennedy has become a new favorite of mine and I look forward to reading more from her. Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Deal: 
 I have to say, this is the first time a girl's been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they've just bagged Brad Pitt. 
 Hannah takes a breath. ""We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That's what happened. Got it?"" 
 I fight back laughter. ""As you wish."" 
 ""Did you really just Princess Bride me?"" 
 ""Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?"" 
 She glowers.

"""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination..."" 
 And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I've ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy. 
 I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a ""perfect couple"" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must lead a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together. 
 ""I don't know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he's handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They're a match, they're a set. They're happy, I can tell. They're what I used to be, they're Tom and me five years ago. They're what I lost, they're everything I want to be. 
 Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her. 
 ""Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I'm living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It's exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you're not joining in. 
 Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself. 
 ""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head."" 
 This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book. 
 'The Girl on the Train' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before the movie came out. Highly recommend!!",13,5,1,486,27.4,43.7,48.41,34.73,15.19,15.02,89.51,75.51,61.32,17.9,12.35,4.73,0.21,0.41,4.12,2.67,5.56,15.23,7.2,0.41,13.17,9.26,7.61,8.02,2.06,17.7,7.2,3.5,3.09,1.85,0.62,0.82,14.81,3.5,11.32,2.47,1.44,1.03,2.67,1.65,3.29,0.41,8.23,4.53,3.5,3.91,1.65,2.06,0.21,0.21,1.03,0.0,12.96,2.26,0.21,0.0,0.41,0.21,0.82,10.08,1.03,0.0,4.73,0.82,0.21,0.0,0.21,0.0,2.26,1.23,0.21,1.03,0.0,0.0,1.85,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.21,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.82,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.0,0.41,0.0,4.73,9.05,0.21,1.65,6.17,0.82,0.0,0.21,4.73,3.7,9.67,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.81,6.38,8.64,0.0,0.82,3.7,2.26,0
"4.5 stars!! 
 ""I like to watch her cry. I taste her tears. I relish them. Because pain is beauty, at least in my world. And everything in my world is pain. Has been since the morning I woke with a gun pressed to my head. "" 
 WOW!! Kick sure delivers a kick in the pants. Our ""hero"" Kick is one messed-up motherf-er, that's for sure, and this book kept me turning the pages to find out what makes him tick. What happened to him that turned him into a cold, tough, seemingly unfeeling S.O.B.? Carmen Jenner's take-no-prisoners style of writing took me on an incredible roller coaster ride of emotions that didn't end until the last word. 
 Kick had one woman who ever got under his skin, and she messed with his head and his heart in a big way. He uses other women, sometimes brutally, and if this bothers you, do not read this book. But if you're looking for a totally HAWT, heart-wrenching, fast-paced read, then Kick is for you! 
 ""I've known her all of a few minutes and already I know I'll catch her, because just like Ivy knew, and Lauren before her, I'm a fucking sucker for the messed up ones, and I ain't met anyone as screwed up as this girl is right now."" 
 Will Kick ever be redeemed? Is he even capable of redemption? Frankly I wasn't sure even up to the end of this story. But Kick meets his match with Indy, a woman who seems to re-awaken his basic human instincts. 
 ""I don't know what it is about her that makes me so fiercely protective and yet so completely fucking at a loss when it comes to what to do with her."" 
 Maybe that's the reason I want her so fuckin' much. Because she's been through hell and she looks like a fuckin' warrior. But if she's a warrior, then what does that make me? Warriors don't need saviours. Warriors save themselves. 
 I loved this book in all its messy, violent and sexy glory!! Grab this one if you are looking for a gritty, hot and wild MC story. Enjoy!

"4.5 - 5 stars!! 
 I absolutely loved this passionate and moody story and I need closure on Kes and Aimee's story, like, yesterday! I can't stop thinking about these characters. This is one of those very broody, very memorable stories that really gets under your skin. The first half of this book completely swept me away and immersed me into the small-town, Midwestern setting. Kestrel and Aimee had a simmering, sizzling attraction that grew from their close friendship as children. Kes, a bruised and battered soul, found something in Aimee that he could cling to and that would give him a glimmer of hope in his stolen youth. 
 Kes was put to work in a traveling carnival at a young age, and while Aimee sees the carnival as a magical, almost mystical lifestyle, Kes sees the much harsher side of ""carnie"" life. His carnival returns to her small town each summer for 2 weeks, and their unlikely friendship blossoms over the years into a sexy, heated, full-blown relationship. 
 ""Fate was against us. Screw that! Kes was moody and difficult, brilliant and beautiful. He scared me and protected me."" 
 Years pass, and finally Kes and Aimee might have the chance as adults to explore their searing and unbreakable bond. Kes has becom a star within the fair circuit, with women throwing themselves at him, as they did when he was younger. Aimee is a schoolteacher, living a safe and plain existence in a town in New England. What will happen when they are reunited? 
 ""He was everything i wasn't, but somehow, together, there was a synergy, an alignment, something that just made sense."" 
 The first half of this book literlly blew me away! I could not put it down. The tone changed slightly in the second half but yet I am still 100% invested in this story and I cannot wait to see what the author has in store for these characters in the next book! Please note that this is book #1 in a series with somewhat of a sudden ending but I highly recommend it. Prepare to fall in love with Kes!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Reviewing a Mara White book is a bit like clenching your hand to your heart. Her books are roller-coaster rides of emotions and THE DELIVERY is no different. Sexy, real, emotional and very gritty, Lana and Mozey will steal your heart even as you stand by in disbelief at the choices Lana makes along the way. But that's like real life, no? 
 Lana is struggling to make ends meet, doing what she loves, helping at-risk kids. Her inner voice is often hilarious, which I appreciated in order to alleviate some of the almost unbearable tension in this story. 
 ""Mozey is a ten. Ten for personality and a fucking TEN for the swimsuit competition. Get the sash and the crown. He's already won. Even my mascara is running."" 
 You know the inevitable is going to happen between these two but even though there is a bit of insta-love, their relationship is a slow-burn and unfolds over the span of time. And when they do get together, WOW!! 
 ""This is a kiss. This is the kiss I will never, ever forget. I may forget everything else, my own name included, but I know I will never forget how I feel in this moment. I won't forget his kiss."" 
 This is a forbidden romance, but don't be put off by Mozey's age when they first meet. This book is a whirlwind! I absolutely loved the author's writing style in The Delivery, it made the story very fresh and different. 
 Despite the grittiness of this story, Mara White is a romantic at heart, and the ending was all that I hoped for! If you are looking for a very different but very sexy and fast-paced story, read The Delivery. You won't soon forget Lana and Mozey.

"4.5 STARS 
 What an amazing story!! Lust, sex, chemistry and tons of action fill Mel and Painter's story. Never a dull moment here and the sex is OFF. THE. CHARTS. There's lots of MC goodness, because there is a fantastic epilogue PLUS other treats in store for readers of Reaper's Fall!! 
 I ADORE Joanna Wylde's writing. She writes MC romance with a certain excitement but also realism that is absolutely addictive. Every one of her men is rough, sexy and real. Reaper's Fall is Painter and Melanie's story and uses one of my favorite tropes, the lovers-to-enemies theme. Their early contact is really limited to just letters while Painter is in prison. The build-up is slow and delicious and when they break apart, as you know that they will, it is emotional and heartbreaking and fiery. I literally devour every book by Joanna Wylde and Reaper's Fall was no different. Although the characters from previous books appear here, this book can abaolutely be read as a standalone but I LOVED seeing all of my ""old friends"". 
 These books are rouch, they are messy, there is not always hearts and flowers. Melanie doesn't always make the right decisions but what I love about Ms W writing is that her characters are always trying to better themselves, and Melanie is no different. And Painter makes no apologies for who he is, and when he and Melanie get together, it is pure heat and emotion. 
 Melanie is very stubborn and rebels against the MC. The actions of the club members are not sugar-coated here but that makes Melanie and Painter's journey that much more bittersweet. And did I mention there's plenty of humor here to balance out the raw passion and emotion and incredibly steamy sex?? 
 ""If I had to fall in love with an asshole, at least he was a hot asshole."" 
 I will read every single book that Joanna Wylde writes. Every story from Ms. Wylde delivers the goods. And, as an added bonus here, there is a FANTASTIC Epilogue!! I can't wait for the next book from this fabulous author.

"There is nothing like the thrill of a new MC book from Joanna Wylde. Her characters feel real and each book is raw, sexy and fresh. Silver Bastard is no different, it is a thrill-ride from beginning to end. I fell in love with the two main characters and I absolutely adored Becca, she is a kick-ass heroine who is fighting for a better life and does so with humor and strength. 
 We first met Puck in Reapers Stand and now it is five years later as Puck is out of prison after taking the fall for his MC. His first night of freedom and he meets Becca, in an awkward situation that turns ugly very fast. Puck is a stand-up guy and he basically saves Becca's life. Several years later, Becca is living in a small town in Northern Idaho, working and attending school. She is only 21 but is much older than her years. 
 Becca knows that Puck is not the right guys for her, she has been trying to avoid trouble since she left home 5 years before. But the problem is that Puck can't stay away from Becca and feels protective of her in every sense. They fight, they argue, they battle, but this book is so filled with humor and fast-paced action that the classic ""will-they-won't they"" feels fresh and new and exciting. I couldn't put this book down! Silver Bastard is one of my favorite Joanna Wylde books and I have read them all. 
 Puck can't stay away from Becca and he is an Alpha MC biker so... you can guess where things lead. Joanna Wylde's incredibly steamy scenes between Puck and Becca and the fantastic storyline kept me hooked from the very beginning. I can't say enough about her writing and her MC books. Although there are many serious and dark issues raised in this book, our hero and heroine eventually get their HEA (of course) and the funny and witty dialogue provided a welcome relief from all the drama. 
 I love all Joanna Wylde's characters and I was excited to see some other characters introduced here. As usual, I can't wait for her next book. If you love great writing with tons of steamy scenes and some rough and gritty drama, then you will love Silver Bastard. 
 Favorite Quote: (because this perfectly captured Puck and Becca): 
 ""We've been in a relationship for five years now,"" Puck said, his voice hard. 'It wasn't normal, it wasn't exclusive... Hell, I don't know what the fuck it was, but we both know that's the truth. Whatever's between us, it's been there since the first night we met.""

"If you're not aware of Sawyer Bennett books, they are highly addictive, sexy, delicious and incredibly warm. The characters are all very human, real, with lots of the same issues and problems we all face in day-to-day life. With a Twist fits the bill perfectly and I literally read this in one sitting. Once again, we have a HAWT hero in the name of Wyatt, who is working undercover to try and bring down a sex slave ring. Hello, hot Alpha law enforcement man! He is paired with FBI agent Andrea, who holds a law degree but who also worked as an exotic dancer in order to pay her way through school. 
 Of course, sparks fly, but in the sexiest, sweetest way, and without a ton of angst. Wyatt is uber-protective of Andrea, gorgeous, and just an all-round super guy. And Andrea...well, one of my favorite things about Ms. Bennett is that she writes very strong, educated, smart heroines. Andrea is no different. 
 These two are pure magic together. The story is fast-paced, sexy and very, sweet. Wyatt and Andrea are incredibly passionate and I loved them together. If you are looking for a hot and sexy, but ultimately very loving, warm and romantic story, then With a Twist is for you! Happy reading!

"This is a juicy, fast-paced and totally enjoyable end to the series. If you love highly erotic, contemporary and funny stories, then this is the book for you. I loved all the scheming, the romance, the laughs and the tears and though that Blake and Jennifer got a beautiful HEA. 
 Nelle always injects a little real life into her stories and I for one adored the little extras at the end of this book. Plus she sure knows how to write some HAWT and sexy scenes! The author does not hold back in this installment and it was a great ending to a fabulously sexy and funny series. If you are looking for some escapist reading that will take you away for a few hours, then this is the book for you! Enjoy!

"do not read much paranormal romance but I highly recommend this book! The characters and the story won me over. Mitch and Frederick are twins and both alpha wolves. Mitch stayed in their area, even after his brother found a mate and even though he accepted that he would forever be alone. 
 Frederick and Simon meet by chance and once again, Cardeno C.'s incredibly loving, warm and sweet style took over to give these two the full life they had both been missing. 
 Blue Mountain is a fairly short story, but is a wonderful, sweet addition to the author's work. Although Simon and Frederick are only really together towards the end of the story, the story and the characters really mesh perfectly together and I loved the direction the story took. I absolutely adored the narrator of this audiobook, even though I liked him best as the voice for Frederick and Mitch. I would like to hear Sean Crisden again as the narrator in future audiobooks. I highly recommend this story and the audio book for any reader of the m/m genre, even those new to the shapeshifter genre. Thank you, Cardeno C. for broadening my reading horizons once again!

"From the first line of this book, I can't even begin to describe the emotions that this story made me feel. Repulsion, anger and deep sadness, but believe it or not, also laughter and hope. S.K. Falls is an amazingly gifted writer, and looks at the world through very twisted glasses. One Last Song was completely unexpected and will stay with me for a long, long time. 
 Saylor suffers from Munchausen Syndrome. She has a compulsion to make herself very ill. All of this is a very sad and desperate attempt at getting attention from her distant, cold and uninvolved parents. She is forced to withdraw from college, and through a series of events stemming from her therapy, she ends up in the TIDD (Terminal Illness and Degenerative Disease) support group at a local hospital. The members of the group all suffer with real, terminal diseases. Saylor is, to put it mildly, in heaven. 
 ""I wanted to stay sick, to force my body to its knees, to make it cry and beg for mercy."" 
 Even though Saylor is deceptive and lying to her new friends in the group, I felt nothing but compassion for her as she is forced to endure a loveless home life, with an absent father and emotionally distant mother. She is isolated from her parents, who in turn, seem isolated from the outside world. 
 ""The only person who came close to being a guest in our house was my dad."" 
 One Last Song is a compelling, powerful story. The author has created an incredibly memorable cast of characters and not one of them ever asks for pity or special treatment. They just want a normal life. Saylor, who had been friendless and alone for her whole life, suddenly finds herself surrounded by friends who actually seem to like her and enjoy her company. And Drew, OMG, he stole my heart. He and Saylor are drawn to each other and she literally blossoms under his attention. But will she able to reveal the truth to him without him running away from her? 
 ""And here I was, clinging to the parapet of life, not quite ready to let go, but not quite ready to clamber on and live it either."" 
 Were there a few plot issues? Yes, but they were minor and did not detract from my enjoyment of this story and the thrill of finding an author with such a unique voice. Much is revealed by the end of the book and I was surprised to see that nothing was as it seemed during the course of the story. The ending left me breathless and wanting more. I look forward to reading many more unique stories from this very talented writer.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Swoon!!! Ladies and gentleman, meet Gray Grayson and prepare to fall in LOVE!! 
 THE FRIEND ZONE is a super-funny, very steamy, and very romantic sports romance that I absolutely adored. It can be read as a standalone although two characters from The Hook-Up make appearances here. If you are looking for a fast-paced, clever story, then THE FRIEND ZONE is for you. 
 I think one of my favorite quotes of the year so far has to be from this book: 
 ""I'm trying to commiserate, you noodle. Because the itching was torture when it grew back. And do not get me started on the pain of waxing. I was certain that evil woman had ripped my lady lips off."" 
 ""Lady lips? Oh Christ."" His gleeful laughter echoes through the stadium. 
 ""This is so not funny,"" I protest, my hands on my hips as his abs clench--which, unf--and he cracks up. ""It was the worst pain of my life. And I've broken my arm in two places."" 
 Lady lips! I love it! But the story is great and the supporting characters all vital to the story and just as interesting as Gray and Ivy. Ivy has vowed never to do casual hook-ups, especially with an athlete. Her sports-agent father's lifestyle turned her off to that. And Gray isn't interested in a monogamous relationship, until of course, he meets Ivy. 
 This book is extremely clever and the author creates a real and meaningful friendship between Ivy and Gray. Their relationship is believable, sweet and honest, and so their eventual sexy times did not feel rushed at all, but instead felt like a perfectly natural progression of their growing passion. 
 And speaking of sex, did I mention that Gray is irresistible? Yep, perfect boyfriend material. The nighttime stadium scene? I died a little. He's an intelligent and incredibly gifted athlete with a bright future ahead if only he can withstand his sorry excuse for a family. 
 ""To me it's a cathedral. I sit here and I feel calm, centered. And yet it's like all the energy of games past remains, coursing through my veins, and I can't wait for the next game."" 
 These two are meant for each other, it's just that they don't quite realize it at the beginning: 
 ""His forearm tenses, and I find him staring at me with wide eyes. Pain resides there, and a sort of longing too. I recognize it in myself -- that need to have someone understand how empty life can feel, as if you're the only one in your universe. 
 Gray holds my gaze for another second then clears his throat. ""Shit, Mac, you're going to have me bawling like a baby soon."" He gives me a lopsided smile."" 
 Ivy and Gray care deeply for each other; they both had sad and lonely lives when they were younger, some of which has spilled over into their young adult lives and which has brought them closer together. But never fear, the author watches over your heart and doesn't let anything too painful happen to it. 
 Gray falls for ivy, despite his surprise at the depth of his feelings for her. It was actually quite beautiful to watch his feelings unfold 
 ""And that strange dichotomy is my Ivy. Insane planner mixed with a free spirit who goes with the flow. A surge of affection hits me, and I sink further into the pillows."" 
 Lest I forget to rave about the sexy times, they are HAWT!! Take one 6'6'' football player who weighs well over 200 pounds, with a drop-dead body and a very sensitive and loving soul and you have the recipe for PERFECT sex! And they both like to act out fantasies. THUD. 
 There are some very serious and sensitive moments in The Friend Zone, but they are handled with sensitivity and grace by the author. And the Epilogue was perfect! Not completely unexpected but tender and loving nonetheless.",3,4,1,656,43.4,33.99,45.73,78.86,12.86,17.53,90.55,72.41,56.55,14.94,10.67,4.88,0.0,1.22,2.59,1.68,4.27,15.4,6.86,1.68,12.65,7.16,5.64,8.99,1.52,14.18,9.15,3.2,2.29,1.37,0.61,0.3,13.11,1.22,11.89,2.29,0.61,1.22,1.68,2.29,3.96,0.15,8.84,6.1,2.29,3.35,1.68,1.37,0.15,0.0,0.46,0.15,12.2,4.42,1.07,0.76,0.3,0.46,1.07,8.23,0.3,0.61,1.37,2.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.59,1.37,0.15,0.61,0.0,0.46,4.27,0.91,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.3,0.15,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.91,5.79,11.59,0.91,0.91,5.49,2.44,0.15,2.13,3.81,3.35,6.4,1.83,0.46,0.15,0.3,0.15,0.0,20.88,6.25,5.03,0.46,1.98,2.44,4.73,0

 Pucked is a witty story about Violet, who has a super funny and very inappropriate mother and a whore of a stepbrother who plays for the the NHL. So she has stayed away from hockey players until she meets Alex, the captain of the Rangers. All that goes out the widow. The writing is funny and light and the sex is great. There is no angst or heavy themes in this book. It is raunchy, funny and filled with tons of sexy times. If you're a fan of sports romance, you'll love this book - Pucked is the perfect, fast-paced summer read!

"Always You is a surprisingly good, second-chance romance that is modern, witty, steamy and filled with believable characters. This is a great debut from Stephanie Rose! I loved the story and absolutely loved the plot. This is an emotional story that grabbed me from the first page. 
 Samantha is stuck in a loveless and heartless marriage and re-connects via Facebook with Lucas, her former college advisor. It is clear from the outset that Sam is with the wrong guy in more ways than one. Her husband Marc is an absentee husband and father. Lucas is wonderful to Sam and her daughter Bella, and Lucas and Bella's relationship makes up much of the heart of this story, it is just amazing. 
 Lucas is, well, irresistible. He is smart, uber-sexy, respectful and H-O-T. Just what Sam needs. And when things with Marc take a nasty turn, Lucas is right there with Sam, supporting her emotionally, and ready to love Bella and Sam forever. Lucas is an amazing character and a perfect book boyfriend!! There are some really romantic scenes in Always You that touched me and melted my heart. As you can probably see, Sam was married when she first reconnects with Lucas but trust me, Marc is a horrible person who needed to be dealt with. Sam just didn't have to courage to act until Lucas came into the picture. 
 There is lots of sexy time and sweet and sexy texting between our Hero and heroine. This book was surprisingly hot, very readable and enjoyable for all fans of steamy contemporary romance. The last scenes in the book were especially touching. I highly recommend this book for romance fans who like some steam to go along with their HEA.

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Silas and Charlie's epic journey continues! I'm a huge fan of this series and Part 2 did not disappoint! Another fantastically thrilling and creative story from Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. 
 ""Never forget, Charlie. 
 Never stop."" 
 NEVER NEVER PART TWO is another completely gripping and thrilling story that continues literally from where Part One left off. The characters continue to enthrall and the plot continues to thicken in the second installment of this very strange tale. Ms. Hoover and Ms. Fisher are two of my favorite authors so it is no surprise that I loved this book and read it in just one sitting. 
 The feeling of disorientation continued in this story and I could not wait to see where Silas and Charlie's journey would go. Alas... more questions are raised and only a few answers are revealed. To me, this is not a paranormal story even though there are elements of what might be the supernatural here. I was very surprised by the turn of events here and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next story. 
 We again have both POVs, which flowed perfectly and added to my enjoyment of the book. Leave it to these two authors to both grip my heartstrings with Silas and Charlie's story, and leave me feeling like I stepped off a roller-coaster ride, all at the same time. 
 As you can see, these books are not standalones but if you like a twisty, thrilling, beautifully-written story, then don't miss Never Never.

"""Someone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things. That stuck with me, because it's so true. We've all got a little bit of good and evil in us."" 
 IT ENDS WITH US is one of THE most important books you'll read this year, maybe ever. It is absolutely stunning. There are very few books that I recommend to my daughter to read but this book is one of them. This story should be read by every woman, husband, boyfriend, son and brother because it contains one of the most powerful messages I have ever experienced. 
 On the surface this book is the story of Lily, who has escaped to Boston from the small town she grew up in. Smart and driven, she opens her own shop and meets Ryle, a funny, handsome and brilliant surgeon. Revealing anything more about this book would do a tremendous disservice to the perfect way that Colleen Hoover has told this story. It builds slowly, bit by bit, to a painful and inevitable conclusion that took my breath away. 
 As with all Colleen Hoover's books, IT ENDS WITH US is a stunner, magnificently written and absolutely unputdownable. My heart almost stopped in several places. It's that good!! Do yourself a favor and read this book - you will never forget it.

"How can that rare beautiful be rendered irrelevant, intangible when I still feel so damn much? 
 I can't even find the words to describe how much I loved this book. Random & Rare is one of those ""rare"" books that I actually read slowly because I just didn't want the story to end. Sexy, incredibly thrilling, creative, emotional, uplifting - this book has it all. I really didn't think anything could match the power and beauty in Lock & Key but the author did it again. 
 Cat Porter is the real deal. She really touched me with this book. The first part of this story is told by Dig. Yes, that is Grace's husband. I never imagined that he could have so much to say, and that his story would get under my skin in the way that it did. Dig and Grace are quite literally soul mates, destined to be together and fiercely loyal to each other always. 
 You might think you know Grace and Dig's story from Lock & Key, but there is so much more to their history! I thought that I loved Miller, but Dig, oh my God, he stole my heart forever. I do not often cry during books (I read a LOT), but Random & Rare reached right down into my heart and squeezed tight. 
 ""My hand stretched out over the warm skin of her stomach. Grace's body was our temple, our bit of holy, where both of us connected and exploded together in some sort of glorious, furious symphony. Her skin was still flush with the pleasure I'd just given her, and my mark stained the skin on her sweet ass. Forever."" 
 Dig's life is not easy. He is a member of a rough MC and he is a trusted officer of the club. But nothing is at it seems and every action has a reaction and a consequence. Cat Porter is a gifted storyteller and all the threads of both books are woven together here into a beautiful, sexy, satisfying and explosive conclusion. 
 ""You're in my bones, Grace. Can't stand straight without you, baby. Can't."" 
 Dig is a fatalist, and his life is a very gritty one. But he loves Grace with all his heart and tries his best to shield her from his violent world. Trust me, their story did not end in Lock & Key and if you love MC stories, Cat Porter is an absolute one-click author. You will fall in love with the characters from these books and will not soon forget them.

 ""But everyone else's random would never be rare for me. My random was a demon that kept attacking me, gorging itself on my entrails like the unsatisfied feral beast it was, dancing his grotesque dance on the road before me.""

"I adore JB Salsbury's Fighting series and Blake and Layla's novella once again proves why she is one of my favorite writers. 
 ""Love is what makes the pain of the fight so worth it."" 
 This story is filled with warmth, love, family, strength and of course, the sexy Blake and his gorgeous Mouse. A Father's Fight is about all these things and much more. Blake and Layla again face tremendous obstacles and their pasts which threaten to interfere into the blissful life they have built together. Blake will do whatever it takes to keep his Mouse safe and to guard his new family no matter what. He is a fighter, for sure, and his strength of character is the glue that holds this story together. 
 I fell in love with Blake even more after reading A Father's Fight! He is sexy, strong, tough and gentle all at the same time. I absolutely loved the steam factor in this one and did not want the story to end! As with all of the books in this series, I craved more when I finished this story and cannot wait for more from the amazingly talented JB Salsbury.

"4 1/2 stars!! 
 What an emotional ride! As a huge fan of this series, I could not wait to dive in to the conclusion of Theo and Lilly's story. These two have been through it all, but Theo, the consummate playboy, has really proved to be loyal and loving and thank God for that! Lilly's horrific past is finally revealed in detail here, so now you can see why she has literally run for the hills every time someone tried to get close to her heart. 
 ""Love. It's the strongest of bonds, and the greatest of vulnerabilities."" 
 Lilly is a strong survivor, and this installment in the series is not for the faint of heart. But stick it out, the rewards are great! I fell in love with Theo all over again, and I have a girl-crush on Lilly. There is suspense, emotion, steamy sexy times and great dialogue in Surrendered. Lilly has finally given her heart to Theo but she still must endure the pain of having her bother Harry pay for the sins of the past. At times, I was very worried Lilly would flee from Theo and all that he offered, but the author gives us an incredibly satisfying conclusion to a wonderful story. 
 ""You make me feel Theo, and I haven't allowed myself to feel anything, good or bad for a long time. I just wanted to be numb. You terrify me, but you thrill me at the same time."" 
 I love Lilly's bother Harry and the fierce loyalty they feel toward each other. I would really love to read more from Harry and hope that he gets his own story some day! (*hint hint*). And Hugo. Well, let's just say I am waiting with baited breath for his story, too, I know it will be a fantastic ride. 
 This is a passionate, messy, lively, sexy story, and there is even some humor thrown in, too. I loved this book and although I will miss Lilly and Theo terribly, I am looking forward to much more from this incredibly talented writer!!

"4 1/2 I-LOVE-LINDEN STARS!! 
 I love a sweet, sexy, hot and romantic story, and The Pact is all this and more! Add a charismatic and irresistible Scotsman? YES, PLEASE! Karina Halle hits another home run with this incredibly engaging and modern tale of dating, love and romance. This is a fun, fast-paced and very enjoyable read and a little bit of a different type of book for this author. And I loved every word. Linden and Stephanie are two incredibly engaging characters, both very endearing and sometimes maddening and in the end, just plain human, with all the insecurities, longings and sometimes-dysfunctional relationships that most of us deal with into our adulthood. 
 These two are best friends, but also find each other irresistible. But they are terrified of ruing their close friendship by becoming involved romantically. So, they make a pact. At Linden's suggestion, they agree at age 25 that if they are not married by the age of 30, then they will marry each other. Sounds like a good idea, no? But the problem is that no one else can measure up to the other during all the years in between. At times, I just wanted to scream, ""Get together already!!"" 
 ""I sip my drink and can't help but feel the slightest bit relieved. In five years, all the dating and the strife could be over. In five years, there's the tiniest possibility that I could marry my best friend."" 
 Linden is hot hot hot and the kind of guy that every girl swoons over. He can't seem to fully give himself to anyone and of course, is madly in love with Stephanie. She, however, is not quite sure if he was just kidding about the pact, but she, too, can't seem to find true love, either. 
 ""I want to tell her all the filthy things I think about, be real, raw and unfiltered. I want to make her cheeks flush from my dirty mouth and her body with desire."" 
 Oh, yes, Linden is a dirty talker. Will they finally see through their stubborn resolve and give in to the feelings they have for each other? Things seem to come to a head during a camping weekend and they both seem to finally see the light. Finally! But will they be able to withstand all the outside forces and their own insecurities to be able to really make their incredible bond last? 
 The Pact has one of the most romantic and heart-pounding endings I have ever read. I was alternately swooning and crying. Karina Halle has written a perfect contemporary romance - it has a believable and relatable hero and heroine, modern settings, real-life problems and lots and lots of incredibly steamy, off-the-charts sex!! Issues with friendships, dating, jobs, family -- this book has it all. I loved this book and fell in love with Linden. Highly recommended for all fans of modern romance!

 4 - 4.5 Stars!! 
 I absolutely loved Fighting Silence! Till Page is a memorable character that I won't soon forget! Struggling against dirt-poor poverty, absentee parents and an inevitable loss of his hearing, this book pulled at my heartstrings and thrilled me from beginning to end. 
 Till is a fighter, taking care of his younger brothers to keep them out of the social services system. His only bright spot in an otherwise dismal existence is his neighbor Eliza Reynolds, who he spends every minute with after school, but who he completely ignores during the day. 
 She is just a gorgeous person, inside and out, and Till is frightened of ruining their relationship with sex, so... they spend part of the book battling their attraction to each other. 
 ""Eliza was a crier. She pretended that it was only when she was mad. That was bullshit though. She cried every time the wind blew north. Happy, sad, angry--it didn't matter. I loved it when she happy cried. I laughed when she angry cried. I was gutted when she sad cried. I'd held her through all of them. But her reaction that night was extraordinary. I guessed my present was pretty extraordinary too though."" 
 Eliza is sensitive but strong. I loved that about her character! This is not a typical fighter story, it is fresh and new and make no mistake, Till and ""Doodle"" BURN up the pages when they get together. This story is told in alternating POV's and flashes forward in time but Aly Martinez does an amazing job with the alternating voices. 
 This is a story of true devotion, fighting for happiness and fighting for the right to love and be loved. Sounds sappy, but this book is so much more! I loved it! 
 ""Till and I both knew we had a strange relationship. It was more than a friendship, but there wasn't romance or sex. There was definitely love though. Immeasurable amounts of it. I knew that Till had this grand fantasy about me. But what he didn't realized was all that he gave me in return. He was the only thing I'd ever had that I honestly thought I couldn't live without. Till Page was my soulmate on every level.""",10,4,1,381,16.52,23.4,40.52,52.69,10.89,18.9,91.34,72.97,59.32,18.64,12.6,5.25,0.26,0.0,4.99,1.57,6.04,15.49,5.51,0.52,11.81,9.19,6.82,10.24,1.84,15.75,7.61,3.67,4.2,2.89,0.0,1.31,14.17,2.36,11.29,1.57,0.52,1.05,0.79,1.31,5.51,0.52,12.86,7.35,5.25,6.3,3.41,2.89,0.26,0.79,1.84,0.26,16.8,7.35,0.52,0.0,1.57,0.26,2.36,9.45,0.52,0.52,2.62,2.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.15,0.26,0.26,1.84,0.79,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.26,4.46,6.04,0.26,0.52,3.94,0.52,0.79,0.26,6.04,9.97,3.94,0.52,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.0,19.16,8.4,3.94,0.0,1.84,2.1,2.89,0
"4.5 stars!! 
 This was my first book by Monica Murphy and it was brilliant! It exceeded all expectations and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series. 
 Sexy, adult, erotic, this book has it all. Owning Violet introduces us to three sisters ""born to wealth, raised to succeed, ready to love, destined to make waves."" As the daughters of the scion of a world-famous fragrance company (it brought Estee Lauder to mind), Violet and her sisters are all very different but all intimately entwined with the future of their family's company. 
 Violet at first seems like a push-over and a doormat, her boyfriend almost openly cheats on her but she looks the other way, all in the name of the company. But I found her to be a compelling character, driven, eager to love and be loved, and above all, very ambitious. This book literally has it all: highly erotic sex scenes, an Alpha male and lots and lots of edge-of-your seat drama. 
 Ryder is a sexy bad-boy co-worker who rose above his rough past to work in corporate America. Violet may appear to have it all, but she experienced a terrible trauma that is still haunting her to this day. While we might first see her as nothing more than a pawn in a rather sick game between Ryder and Pilar, a scheming woman who wants to bring her down, she is much, much more that that. Violet is no pawn and slowly begins to realize that the sexual relationship she has with Ryder might be much, much more and she must find her inner strength to beat Pilar at her own game. 
 Owning Violet is an adult, erotic, steamy book and I loved the story and the amazingly intense scenes with her and Ryder. He is hot as hell, damaged, sexy, smart and ambitious. The steam factor was just genius. All in all, I loved this book and can't wait to read more from this author. I recommend this for anyone who loves a sexually-charged, fast-paced storyline with some very memorable characters.

"3.5 - 4 stars!! 
 This book started off right in the middle of a hot love story between Natalie and Devlin, a famous rock star. But things suddenly crash and burn when it is revealed that actually a bet started it all! But even though Devlin began sleeping with Natalie on a whim, he actually fell hard for her and spends the rest of the book trying to win her back. 
 I loved Natalie's feisty spirit!! Even though she is much younger than Devlin, she was no push-over. It isn't easy being in love with a rocker but Natalie holds her own with the fans, the groupies, touring and all the pressure that comes with being in the public eye. And Devlin...swoon!! Sexy, smart, talented... but will he do what it takes to get Natalie back before it's too late? I loved his Alpha ways and their scenes together are HOT HOT HOT!! 
 This was my first book in the series and I totally was at home with the cast of characters. There was plenty of background given on each rocker and I loved all of the band members and their significant others. If you are looking for a sexy, rocker book with lots and lots of steam, then The Rocker Who Shatters Me is for you. Terri Anne Browning writes a quick-paced, sexy and loving story and I am looking forward to reading her other books. Enjoy!

"4.5 STUNNING STARS!! 
 ""You make hell feel like heaven, Blaire."" 
 WOW!!!! This series is one of the most readable series out there. Mia Asher is why I read contemporary romance. From the first page to the every last word, I was hooked, invested in the story and emotionally connected to the characters. If you have read the first book, EASY VIRTUE, then you know that Blaire is then between two men, Ronan and Lawrence. Who will win her heart? Will either of them? 
 Tonight I let a man f* my brains out so he could eradicate a different man from my heart. I've done it before but, this time, it didn't work. Ronan was everywhere. In every kiss and every touch. He still is. 
 Ronan and Lawrence. Two irresistible men, both owning part of Blaire's heart, but in different ways. I can't decide which one I loved more, the author did an outstanding job creating two men who both stole my heart. Although Blaire and Lawrence's relationship was originally based on an arrangement for sex only, he became someone who Blaire could really fall in love with. But there's Ronan, always Ronan, on her mind and in her heart. 
 Ronan has become embittered, jaded and filled with hate for Blaire. But the fantastic way in which the author tells the story here in multiple POV's had me racing through the story to see where it would end up. I did not want poor Ronan to be so bitter! He tries to erase Blaire from his mind but she is always there. 
 When my lips touch hers , she closes her eyes and gives in to the kiss. I don't. I can't. And I f*king hate myself for it because even though I'm kissing this woman, it's Blaire who I taste. 
 I absolutely LOVED the conclusion to this story. It is rare for me to love a sequel as much as the first book but SWEETEST VENOM is pure gold. I applaud Mia Asher for the ending she gave to her characters here and dare I even hope that there could be more books with some of these characters? I will never forget Blaire, Ronan and Lawrence.

"April Emerson's earlier book The Righteous and the Wicked is one of the most under-rated books of the year so I jumped at the chance to read her new release. Out of the Dark is a moody, dreamy, very sexy story about following your heart and living life to the fullest. 
 Carina is newly-graduated from culinary school and travels to Italy as a graduation gift from her parents. She meets Stefan, a gorgeous, sexy businessman and falls madly in lust. Yes, there is a little insta-love here but it works perfectly in the story as Stefan is a very powerful and commanding man who holds many in his thrall. 
 Carina agrees to stay at Stefan's vineyard and what began as a brief trip turns into a long stay, with her whole life changing. But things are not as they seem and her perfect world begins to crumble bit by but with the arrival of Stefan's nephew Enzo at the vineyard. 
 Will Carina follow her heart or will she be trapped in a life that is slowly beginning to suffocate her? April Emerson has a lush, dreamy writing style and she created a beautiful world about winemaking in both Italy and in New York. This is an escapist story for sure but if you like a little thriller mixed in with your erotic romance, then this is the book for you. Despite a few minor plot weaknesses, I loved this story and fell in love with both Enzo and Stefano!",2,4,1,249,84.43,68.22,38.18,85.58,22.64,16.06,87.55,70.68,54.22,10.04,7.23,0.8,0.0,1.61,4.02,0.4,2.81,17.27,9.64,0.4,16.06,5.22,4.02,9.24,0.4,12.45,9.64,4.82,3.61,0.8,1.61,1.2,5.62,0.4,5.22,0.4,0.4,0.0,1.61,0.8,3.21,0.0,8.03,6.02,1.61,2.01,1.2,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.65,4.82,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.8,2.01,7.63,0.8,0.0,3.61,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.81,0.0,0.0,2.81,0.4,0.0,3.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.61,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,6.02,11.24,0.0,3.21,8.03,0.4,0.0,0.0,4.82,2.41,6.43,0.8,0.4,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,10.44,3.61,3.61,0.4,0.4,1.2,1.2,0
"4 - 4.5 stars!! 
 ""Because of him I learned that there's a learning curve to love. Because of him I realized that there's always that one person that destroys and sends you back into the world to fend for yourself. And it doesn't matter how hard they hurt you. Whether you like it or not, the scars on your heart spell out their name."" 
 I absolutely fell in love with this author and this book!! This was my first book by Calia Read and it blew me away. Ruin You Completely is the story of Mathias who agrees to travel to Germany to become piano instructor to a nineteen year old rising star named Katja. I have not read any of the other books in this series, and for me, this story absolutely stood on its own. Matthias is the classic sexy, aloof bad-boy, but he and Katja have a bond that is built up slowly through this book. I loved reading about the world of piano and music. But the author also brings out the steam factor in a big way, and these two must struggle to keep their feelings on a professional level in light of their student-teacher relationship. 
 ""His skin was smooth and hot. Mathias jumped. I jerked my hand back, realizing too late what I'd done. When we touched, it was never good. He was the match. I was the fire. We both went up in flames."" 
 Katja and Matthias belong together but they are both too stubborn to act on their feelings. Their timing is terrible and my heart broke for them and for the ones around them that would inevitably get hurt by their behavior. This story is told in alternating POV's which worked perfectly here. From the German settings, to the story, to the characters and the plot, I loved everything about this book! I adored Katja and how she grew and changed after she met Mathias. 
 ""But since I met Mathias, I stopped caring. Stopped questioning. And I loved it. He showed me that sanity is safe. Boring. And madness was unpredictable. Beautiful. Of course I would snatch the chance to spend time with him."" 
 (The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star read for me was a minor inconsistency in the story, that in no way detracted from my enjoyment of this fantastic book!) 
 I loved the ending of this book and I can't wait to read more books by this author!

"4.5 Stars! This story is beautiful, wild, messy and sexy. And a love letter to New Zealand. 
 The author has written in incredibly vivid book about taking chances and throwing your carefully-laid plans aside to follow your true passion. I felt as though I was actually watching gorgeous pink sunsets, exploring underground rivers while floating in tubes and experiencing breathtaking mountain views. I felt transported to New Zealand while reading this story and for that experience, I thank the author. 
 ""You won't see anything more inspiring than this,"" I say, gesturing to the sky, now gold. ""Recreate it, capture it. Let it be wild, let it be messy. It's the first sunrise of many more to come. You can't screw it up. If you do, there's always tomorrow."" 
 Joshua Miles has one night of mind-blowing sex with an incredible woman who is about to leave Vancouver for good to return to New Zealand. Josh realizes that his life in Vancouver is empty and that this is his chance to finally experience life before he begins classes at art school. He lives at home with his mother and works part-time. There is nothing really holding him back excerpt his disapproving mother. There's only one problem: he doesn't know the name of the woman he is following all the way to New Zealand. 
 Gemma was traveling alone, trying to make some changes in her life, when she met Josh. She, too, felt an incredible connection with him but leaves Vancouver as planned to return home. Little does she know that Josh will turn up in her hometown! The problem? She is already in a relationship. She is also noncommittal and believes she will only end up hurting Josh. 
 Circumstances then find Gemma and Josh along with two others traveling across New Zealand in an old VW bus. Karina Halle writes an amazing alternate POV story about finding yourself, falling in love and forgiving the past. Josh pretty much wears is heart on his sleeve from the very beginning, and it is Gemma who remains closed off and guarded. The dialogue is fantastic and the sex scenes are ah-may-zing. 
 Will Gemma end up breaking Josh's heart? Will Josh let Gemma give up on her own dreams? This is an incredible story about finding yourself, and chasing your passion. I felt the longing and angst and ache right along with the characters. 
 ""I think I ache for things I may never have. I long for purpose, for life, and yet sometimes I think I'm too afraid to live."" I pause. ""Do you ever worry, that there's something out there that you're missing?"" 
 Where Sea Meets Sky is a gorgeous story that shouldn't be missed!!

"""Life happened, and then happened some more, and kept happening until you were so caught up in life itself that you forgot to actually live it."" 
 What a raw, beautiful and unflinching look into the world of the one percenters! This is NOT a pretty story - it is filled with lust and mayhem and violence - but it perfectly tells the story of Eva's parents, Preacher and Wheels (Debbie). 
 This is one of my top favorite series EVER and I highly recommend reading the books in order. BUT you can read the first book right away to get a flavor for Madeline Sheehan's writing. 
 Preacher lived an entire lifetime before we ever met Eva as a young child in 'Undeniable.' His life was hard. But he was a survivor. 
 ""Prison had been a painful wake-up call for Preacher. It had taken the man he'd been, beaten the holy hell out of him, flushed him down the shitter, and sputtered and spit him back out a ravaged and shameful shell."" 
 Preacher met Debbie on the road. She, too, was a survivor and did what she had to do to get by on the streets. Madeline Sheehan took two very damaged and hardened souls and created something beautiful which is why I absolutely love her writing style. 
 The book is told as a flashback as Preacher lays dying in the hospital. He is finally telling his story to his beloved daughter Eva. But everything I thought I knew about Preacher and Debbie was wrong! Preacher's tale is heartbreaking but I could not put this book down. I had to see it thought to the end. 
 Preacher was in the biker life no matter what. Loyal and true to his family and biker brothers no matter what, he was a Demon through and through. 
 ""According to the law and the state of New York, he was indeed a free man. But in reality, he wasn't free at all. He belonged to the Silver Demons body and soul, for better or worse. And if he stayed on this path, this wasn't going to be the last time he went to prison."" 
 Heart-wrenching and gritty, 'Undeserving' is nonetheless an incredibly readable story. It must be experienced. Madeline Sheehan does not write hearts-and-flowers stories. But her biker romances are must-reads. While this wasn't as raw as 'Undeniable', it is still one of the best examples of this genre. I can't wait for more books from Ms. Sheehan. She is one of my auto-buy authors. 
 Favorite quote: 
 ""I noticed you."" Debbie's eyes darted back inside the cart, colliding with Preacher's. I noticed you. Those three words took flight, finding and nudging awake long hidden places inside of her.",6,4,1,450,49.0,45.32,17.12,43.39,12.86,18.89,88.44,71.56,56.67,14.0,8.67,2.44,0.22,1.11,4.89,0.0,5.33,14.22,7.33,1.33,12.89,8.44,3.56,9.11,2.0,17.78,6.67,3.11,3.78,1.78,0.89,1.11,11.33,1.78,9.33,1.56,0.22,1.11,0.89,2.0,4.0,0.44,5.78,3.56,2.0,0.89,0.22,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.22,0.22,15.78,6.89,0.22,0.22,0.0,0.67,4.89,8.22,0.67,0.0,1.78,4.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.44,0.0,0.0,1.11,0.0,3.33,2.22,0.44,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22,0.0,0.22,0.89,0.22,1.33,0.0,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.44,7.11,9.56,0.67,1.78,6.22,0.89,0.0,0.44,2.89,9.11,3.56,0.44,0.22,0.0,0.22,0.0,0.0,19.78,7.56,4.0,0.0,0.44,3.56,4.22,0
"3.5 stars! 
 Abbi Glines' books are a guilty pleasure for me. I love the Southern charm, the sexy boys, and the beautiful, sweet girls. When You're Back is the second book in Reese and Mase's story and other characters from my other favorite books all make appearances here. 
 I loved River ""Captain"" Kipling! This guy is SEXY and broody. He is a bit mysterious and I am really looking forward to reading more about him! 
 ""I can change your world, too, sweetheart. But I'll wait my turn."" 
 We also have Mase's cousin Aida here who gives the cold shoulder to sweet, loving Reese. I really liked how Reese blossomed in this book and how loving and devoted Mase is to her. He is one of my favorite of Abbi Glines' characters and he is definitely book boyfriend material. Their scenes are touching, sexy and sweet, just what I expect from the Rosemary Beach series.

"WHOA!! RELEASE ME reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance. And of course with Mr. David Gandy as the inspiration for the character of Hudson Chase, well, that's a home run for me (confession time: I pretty much cast David Gandy as the inspiration for almost every book I read!) And Hudson Chase literally fills every scene he is in. Such a complex character, domineering and cold in most areas of his life but warm, sexy and loving with Alessandra. I loved the duality of his nature. 
 RELEASE ME begins right after the first book and Allie has experienced some very, very difficult times. Circumstances have made it so that she is actually in business with Hudson Chase, the one man she wants to forget. The corporate intrigue is described with great detail and is written very realistically. Allie must pull herself together and face being in the public spotlight, all the while trying to forget her true feelings for Hudson. Hard to do when this gorgeous man is literally in her face at every turn. 
 And boy do the sparks fly between these two!! The sex scenes are SMOKING hot. The chemistry is perfect and with the added bonus of imagining David Gandy as Hudson Chase, well...the scenes between Allie and Hudson were just perfect. I read lots and lots of contemporary erotic romance and RELEASE ME has some of the most memorable love scenes I have ever read. I absolutely loved how Hudson pursued Allie because he just knew they were meant to be together. 
 I highlighted too many parts of this book to quote here! The romance level was off the charts and I loved the feeling of being swept away by the Chicago setting and the exotic locales. There is a very dramatic development that occurs late in this book and it had me holding my breath in suspense! Fair warning, this book does end in quite the cliffy, but I am confident that the authors will resolve Hudson and Allie's story to my satisfaction! 
 If you like passionate, fast-paced romance with a touch of suspense, you will love this series. Can't wait for the third book! I need it, like, now!!

"OMG...I LOVE TRIPP!! No one writes NA quite like Abbi Glines. The heat, the longing, the first loves...You Were Mine has it all. I absolutely love the Rosemary Beach series and the previous books must be read before you read Bethy and Tripp's story. Their history is essential to this book. 
 This book is told in flashbacks alternating with present events. Bethy and Tripp were in love years before but certain events tore them apart and led them to the current day. They are both filled with regret and anger and yes, a huge and undeniable attraction toward each other. I love that all the characters that I love from this series make appearances here, and it is especially poignant seeing their happiness in the face of Tripp and Bethy's misery. 
 I fell in love with Tripp. He will do nothing to stop at giving Bethy the happiness she deserves. This book has a lot of emotion and angst and WOW, is it ever hot!! Abbi Glines really knows how to turn up the steam. This is a fabulously satisfying entry in the Rosemary Beach series and should not be missed!!

"Crying!! From laughter. This book would make a great movie! 
 Alice Clayton writes funny. sexy, adult romantic comedies. There's plenty of steam and always just the right amount of emotional tension to deliver a good, light, satisfying read. 
 Mai Tai'd Up is the story of Chloe and Lucas. This is a standalone and although Chloe was mentioned in Screwdrivered, you do not need to read the previous books! You can dive right in, and you will enjoy the story. 
 Chloe is a ""runaway bride"" and realizes that she was not in love with her fiancee. Much to the horror of her very proper family, she picks up and moves away to begin a whole new chapter in her life. Her passion is reuse animals and she opens a rescue center for pit bulls. And that brings her to the handsome veterinarian in town, Lucas. 
 The two begin a flirtation and and Chloe really begins to fall for Lucas. I mean, who wouldn't? A sexy vet? Hello! I loved their scenes together, and their relationship was a slow-build. There is one thing that Lucas can't stand, and when he finds out about Chloe's almost-trip to the altar, things blow up. 
 I absolutely loved how independent and feisty Chloe was. She is no wallflower! She's smart and no pushover. Often heroines can be kind of a door mat but not Chloe. And there are plenty of really funny moments in this book to go along with the swoon-y romance. Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a fresh, fun and breezy read. Alice Clayton really knows how to deliver a well-written, well-paced story. Oh, and this is a great book for dog lovers!

"6 STARS!!! 
 Brilliant!! It took me a while to gather my thoughts on this story. I don't even know what to say about this book other than it was fan-freaking-tastic. Beth Flynn is a master storyteller. Let me stop right here and say that if you have not read Nine Minutes, you must must must read that book before starting this one. OUT OF TIME is filled with spoilers as well as a huge cast of characters that will have your head spinning if you have not yet read the first book. 
 The events that occur in OOT are absolutely mind-boggling. Cathy and I both thought we knew where this story would go, but believe me, even in our wildest imaginations, we never could have guessed the twists and turns that occurred in this book. 
 We are both huge Grizz fans. I loved him even more after reading the flashback scenes and learning about this childhood (such as it was.) His devotion/obsession with Ginny was more fully explained and the use of flashbacks was perfection. 
 A word about that: Cathy is a tough reader, almost impossible to please, and she LOVED this book! She actually called it ""perfect""! And that word sums up Beth Flynn's storytelling ability. Every character in Out of Time is essential, there are no throwaway scenes, and absolutely no unnecessary drama. Make no mistake, this book is violent, it is gritty but it is unbelievable gripping, intense and sexy. 
 My heart broke several times over while reading this story. And while I am a GFFL (Grizz Fan for Life!), Beth Flynn did an amazing job with Grunt's character. His love for Ginny is endless. This is the kind of book that must be savored, re--read and discussed. There is that much going on. And the world of MC's is not in any way sugar-coated yet the story is immensely readable and unforgettable. 
 At the core of this series is the love Grizz has for Ginny. It is unending. 
 OUT OF TIME is without question one of the best books we have read this year. This series is a must-read. Don't miss out.

"This is a fun, loving, sexy and very satisfying M/M read from Susan Mac Nicol. Gideon is a famous chef but ironically lost his sense of taste and smell after a traumatic event and finds himself angry and explosive at most everyone around him. His restaurant is thriving but he is still traumatized by recurring nightmares and anxiety. 
 Enter Eddie, a young chef who is instantly attracted to his boss Gideon but finds the gruff facade and the fact that he is the boss very off-putting. Will the two of them be able to fight through the barriers that stand in their way? I loved reading the sexy banter between all of the characters in this book and especially with Eddie's very colorful and funny friends. I also loved the reading about the sights and sounds on London. 
 This book is filled with very British references which I loved. It is a very steamy, passionate, very sexy and humorous story with a very happy ending for both of our heroes. It is a very sweet and loving book, and I absolutely enjoyed every minute! All in all, highly recommended for all readers of M/M romance who would like a little something on the lighter side.

"3.5 - 4 stars!! 
 This was the first book I read by this author and I was very pleasantly surprised! I did not know anything about this book going in and read this sexy and erotic story in one sitting. Alix has a sex addition that has interfered with her personal and professional life. She knows she has a compulsion and she just cannot help herself. She has tried recovery and twelve-step programs to no avail. When she sees a handsome and sexy stranger at her hotel night after night, she knows she is heading down a dangerous path again. 
 But John notices her, too, and because of his profession, he is almost 100% sure that she has an addiction. He then begins a secret (well, on his part - she does not know who he is) relationship with her within the confines of a friend's BDSM club. 
 Addict is a highly erotic, very sexy and explicit story that actually has a lot of heart and soul and can be read in one sitting. John and Alix are incredible together and their scenes are highly charged. John is one sexy Dominant!! If you are not uncomfortable in reading about Alix's uncontrollable sexual urges, then by all means grab this erotic story and enjoy!!",5,4,1,211,16.54,72.73,2.32,78.62,16.23,16.11,90.52,73.93,58.77,16.11,11.85,1.42,0.0,0.47,9.0,0.47,4.27,16.11,5.21,3.79,9.0,9.95,5.21,9.95,2.37,18.96,5.69,5.21,3.32,2.37,0.47,0.47,10.43,0.95,9.48,2.84,0.95,0.95,1.42,0.47,3.32,0.0,6.16,4.74,0.95,1.42,0.47,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.64,2.84,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9,12.32,0.0,0.47,6.64,2.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.32,0.47,0.0,2.37,0.0,0.47,7.11,1.42,0.47,0.0,0.95,0.0,4.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.47,3.79,7.11,0.95,0.95,4.74,0.47,0.0,0.47,3.79,1.9,11.37,0.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.17,4.74,3.32,0.0,3.32,0.95,2.84,0
"Tiffany Reisz's writing is pure perfection. Her books are among my all-time favorites and The King was an absolute delight to read, from beginning to end. I have always loved Kingsley Edge so I couldn't wait to read an entire book about him! And once again, the author completely captivated and enthralled me. 
 ""He thought of nothing, remembered nothing, but felt everything."" 
 This book mainly tells the story of Kingsley's relationship with Soren but there are plenty of other characters making an appearance in this book. Of course, I am addicted to Kingsley and Soren so their scenes together are completely mind-blowing and absolutely satisfying. This is a very adult and sophisticated book, the prose is gorgeous and the dialogue is pure genius. 
 Even though I though I know Kingsley's story, the author provides plenty of delicious surprises along the way. I LOVED this book!!! It's sexy, funny, incredibly dramatic and gut-wrenching and completely amazing. I did miss Nora, she is not really the focus of The King but she plays a pivotal role nonetheless. The focus here is on Kingsley and his story. I adored the author's snappy banter, smart storyline and very topical themes. 
 ""What's your poison?"" the bartender asked, and Kinglsey answered, ""Blonds."" 
 The King is a must-read!! You will lose yourself in this book. I miss Kingsley already!

"4.5 stars!! 
 Maybe Not is the funny, sexy and un-put-downable story of Warren and Bridgette and their sometimes rocky and always passionate road from enemies to lovers. This is a novella spin-off of MAYBE SOMEDAY and must, must, must be read after MAYBE SOMEDAY, which by the way is one of my all-time favorites and is not to be missed. There is a major spoiler in this story that will take away a bit from your enjoyment of Maybe Someday if you are a first-time reader. 
 Once again, Colleen delivers a fresh, perfectly-written, intense and witty storyline that kept me reading well into the night. Warren can't stand his new roommate Bridgette at first, but their constant bickering, fighting and pranking quickly turns into something more: 
 ""Oh, my God. I'm obsessed. 
 I'm like a stalker. 
 I am a stalker."" 
 ""She's so confusing, She's so frustrating. She's so damn unpredictable. 
 She's nothing I've ever wanted in a girl. And absolutely everything I need."" 
 I'm kinda obsessed with Colleen's characters and Maybe Not is no excerption. The dialogue and the story are flawless and remind me once again why I will read anything this woman writes. Oh, and there's also plenty of steam in this one to please every romance reader.

"I can't quite put into words the beauty, heartbreak, emotions and sensuality of this book. Of course, Leah Raeder has a gift with words, that was evident from Unteachable and Black Iris. But Cam Girl took so many twists and turns that my head (and my heart) were left reeling. 
 A book about love, acceptance, sexuality and I think also friendship and loyalty, Cam Girl is one of my favorite books of the year. There is a rawness to Ms. Raeder's writing that is addictive and very real and very challenging. Vada and Ellis kept me constantly guessing, constantly on edge and ultimately, left me with a much deeper understanding of the human condition. 
 Vada is an artist who has become unable to draw like she had in the past. She is forced to drop out of grad school. But she never stops thinking like an artist and seeing the world through a artist's eyes. 
 ""Art is an imperfect impression of the world. As the self is an imperfect impression of the soul."" 
 This story is about losing love, finding love and learning to love yourself. I highlighted so many parts of this book, that I can't possibly pick out my favorite quotes! Vada and Ellis' journey was suspenseful, sexy and breathtaking, and I'm not revealing more of the plot other than to say read the blurb, and then dive right into this fabulous, sexy and beautifully written book. Ms. Raeder's prose is lyrical and her words come alive on the page. 
 ""My love is savage and rapacious. It isn't content to the touch. It wants to be inside, crawl into the marrow, caress each vein until the cells are all mixed up and there is no you and me anymore, no secrets or shadows sliding between our skin."" 
 Be prepared to be challenged. Cam Girl is not your everyday story. It is filled with unforgettable characters and a story I won't soon forget.

 Tessa and Luke. They absolutely can't stand each other...but really they are perfect for each other! All I Want is the second book in the Alabama Summer series and can be read as a standalone although it is recommended that you read Book #1 first. I have not read the first book and I still loved this second installment in the series. The sex is HOT, the attraction undeniable and the story fast-apced and gripping! Tessa and Luke are two incredibly stubborn people who just can't seem to stop torturing each other. Tessa broke up with Luke for what she thought was good reason (if a little misguided) and while he can't forgive her, he also can't seem to stay away from her, either. 
 I'm a sucker for a hot Alpha in a uniform and Luke is one protective, sexy cop. He has a very, very painful family life, one that he hides from Tessa, much to her dismay. Despite her initial resentment of Luke, and jealousy over his random hook-ups, she really wants to be there for him emotionally. 
 Much of this book is spent with these two fighting and then having scorching hot sex. J. Daniels can really write a super-hot, sexy and fast-paced read that will keep you very entertained. This book is as lighthearted as some of her other books but it is very enjoyable and I recommend it for fans of second-chance romance and super-hot, sexy, Southern Alphas who won't take no for an answer! And not to fear, these two have a HEA, even after all of their emotional ups and downs. And I can't wait for the next book in this series, Reed! Bring it on!",4,4,1,286,31.07,23.41,4.46,46.66,15.89,13.99,88.46,74.83,61.89,13.99,9.09,2.1,0.0,0.7,4.55,1.05,4.9,19.58,5.94,3.85,11.89,9.09,4.9,9.79,3.15,14.69,9.09,6.29,1.4,0.7,0.0,0.7,12.94,1.05,11.89,1.75,0.35,3.15,1.4,2.45,5.94,0.0,8.74,4.9,3.15,5.24,1.75,2.1,0.35,0.7,0.0,0.0,12.24,4.55,0.35,0.0,1.75,0.35,1.05,7.34,0.0,0.0,2.45,2.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.15,0.35,0.0,2.45,0.35,0.0,2.1,0.35,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.05,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.05,0.35,4.9,5.94,0.0,0.35,3.5,0.35,0.0,1.75,2.8,1.05,6.99,1.05,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.0,18.88,5.59,5.24,0.0,2.45,2.45,3.15,0
"4 1/2 stars! 
 It's hard to believe that Exposure is the debut novel by Morgan & Jennifer Locklear. I absolutely love stories about Hollywood and the movie industry, so I was completely drawn into this book from the very beginning. It's filled with enormous Hollywood egos, tabloid drama, lots of sex and lots and lots of humor. Do you love a look at the inner workings of a movie set and all the behind-the-scenes drama? Then Exposure is for you. It's a fairly light, quick read, but the writers don't skimp on plot or character development. This is a fantastic debut book and I can't wait to read more from this writing duo. 
 I loved the POV's from the all the main characters. I fell in love with David, he is totally swoon worthy, and what? He's actually a NICE guy? Amazing!! Shauna is a brilliant and feisty publicist, and her chemistry with David is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. There is enough steam in Exposure to satisfy readers of contemporary romance but this is a great, character-driven story so all the scenes feel natural and nothing is ever forced or rushed. 
 If you are looking for a fresh, well-written story, with characters that you will actually care about and a story that you will remember long after you finish the book, then I highly recommend Exposure.",3,4,1,223,49.9,45.37,17.66,97.99,14.87,19.73,80.27,65.92,55.61,11.66,6.73,2.69,0.0,2.69,1.35,0.0,4.93,16.14,8.97,1.35,11.21,8.97,5.83,8.97,1.35,13.9,6.73,5.38,1.79,0.45,0.45,0.9,9.42,2.24,7.17,1.35,0.45,0.45,1.79,2.24,2.69,0.45,6.73,6.73,0.0,2.69,2.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.31,5.38,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.45,2.24,4.93,0.0,0.0,0.45,1.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.59,1.35,0.0,2.24,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9,4.93,6.28,1.35,0.45,3.59,1.79,0.0,0.9,4.04,2.24,7.62,0.9,0.45,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,21.08,4.48,5.38,1.35,1.35,3.14,5.38,0
"I can't say much about this book because I don't want to give the plot away but I was completely and totally immersed once again in the world of the Weavers and the Hawks!! This book has a little bit of a different tone to it than the previous books because there are lots of questions that are answered. This series is EPIC!! (And I would LOVE to see it made into a mini-series.) I'm in denial that there is only one more book left in this series!

"5 DARK AND SEXY STARS!!! 
 Pepper Winters has created yet another richly woven story in Final Debt, along with even more backstory and fantastic insight into the series' characters. It is difficult for me to adequately describe my feelings about this book and the characters, first because I've read early copies of almost every one of them and second because Jethro and Nila are two of my favorite main characters. It is hard to say the word ""hero"" in the same sentence as Jethro because of the dark nature of this series, but trust me, he truly becomes the man he is meant to be in Final Debt. And the Epilogue? Pure gold. 
 I was completely and utterly satisfied with the way the author concluded this series. My emotions were all over the place while reading this last book and the Epilogue. At times I was fearful that the worst would happen, and at other times I was hoping against hope that Nila and Jethro would overcome all of the dark forces that conspired against them. To say this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. The historical-romance-themed tone of this series again shines through in this book and I am THRILLED at the announcement of a related book about William Hawk! The only thing that would make me happier is if these books were made into a movie or television series. 
 Expect LOTS of surprises in this incredibly satisfying conclusion to the Indebted Series. My heart is breaking a little at saying goodbye to Jethro and Nila.",17,5,1,260,70.09,14.4,28.56,74.27,18.57,19.23,88.08,71.54,57.31,12.69,6.15,4.62,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.77,6.54,19.23,8.46,1.92,14.23,7.69,4.23,7.69,0.0,13.08,7.69,6.92,1.54,0.38,0.77,0.38,14.62,1.92,12.69,2.31,2.31,2.31,2.31,1.54,3.08,0.0,6.92,4.62,1.15,3.46,1.92,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.38,3.46,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.38,2.31,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.15,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.38,3.85,0.77,0.0,2.31,0.77,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.77,6.54,0.38,0.0,3.85,1.54,0.0,0.77,4.23,4.23,4.23,1.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.38,4.23,1.92,0.38,1.54,0.77,1.54,0
"My soul is literally crying after reading this book!! Just when I thought that Pepper Winters could not thrill and shock me more, she pulls out all the stops in this latest book in the centuries-old Weaver/Hawk family feud. This is a long, very dark, brutal yet sexy and erotic story. I am completely addicted to Jethro and Nila. Bring on the next book! And the peek into the upcoming Ruin and Rule was a pleasant surprise. This series is like crack - you can't stop and you constantly crave more. Thanks, Pepper, for another fantastic book that kept me up all night reading.

"4.5 - 5 stars!! Fresh, funny, sexy and very, very original. 
 Shiver was a delight to read and I absolutely loved this sexy, romantic comedy!! The banter between Ethan and Lissa was snappy, real and fun, and when the book took a few turns into some serious topics, I loved it. 
 This book was a total surprise for me and I couldn't stop turning the pages. CM Foss is a talent to watch! Shiver has it all: sexy romance, witty banter, well-rounded characters and a very catchy storyline. Lissa and Ethan's story could have almost been split into two books, but I'm so glad it wasn't. 
 Lissa is a force to be reckoned with, a girl who doesn't play games and knows what she wants out of life. She decides to forego college to pursue her dream of training horses professionally. Ethan offers her a job at his farm, the two having been former platonic roommates. Will these two be able to work together as boss and employee? This story is fresh and original and was nothing that I expected. Ethan is sexy, funny and of course, not relationship material. 
 These two characters grew and matured and their romance was HOT and smexy!! The author tackles a few serious subjects in Shiver with great sensitivity and without talking down to the reader. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a sexy, funny and very heartwarming story with lots and lots of steam. I can't wait to read more from CM Foss!

"If you are looking for a sweet, romantic military romance with a light dose of angst, then Soldier On is for you. This is a standalone story and will truly warm your heart and make your pulse race. Steph and Brandon are two wonderfully-written characters and I was rooting for them to make it from the very start! But Brandon (foolishly) is hiding a whopper of a secret from Steph that might spell the end of their very new and fragile relationship. 
 Brandon is a handsome, smart, driven and honorable guy and you would think he would be the perfect match for Steph. But she has a deeply rooted hatred of the military for her own reasons and he is scared to tell her the truth about himself. 
 This is a lovely book with a moderate amount of steam and a fast-paced storyline. The author has a beautiful writing style and handles some very heavy topics with great sensitivity and care. If you are looking for a fairly quick, heart-warming story, then Solider On is definitely for you.

"Having read and loved Incandescent, I couldn't wait to read Affliction, the second book in the Knight's Rebels MC series. Affliction was a but of a surprise, having a much more emotional story than the first book in the series. This book can absolutely be read as a standalone, although the characters are first introduced in Book One and some of the plot might be a little spoiler-ish. 
 Sy is angry, gruff, and hard-edged, having suffered a very, very painful loss several years before. He spends the first part of the book acting like a complete jerk towards our heroine Holly, and at times I almost felt like the author was making him into a lost cause. Holly is spirited and outgoing and we first meet her in Book One. She meets Sy when her best friend becomes involved with the Club President. 
 Holly, too, has spiraled into a very dark place and Sy is drawn to her and knows that he can help her overcome her emotional scars. I grew to love Sy while reading this book and absolutely adored the protective way he treated Holly. While this story might seem like it is dark and very emotional, the sex scenes are off the charts hot and very, very steamy. And, there is actually a beautiful love story here and a lovely message about forgiveness, acceptance and letting go of the past. All in all, this is a great story for all fans of MC romance. I can't wait to read more from this author!

"4.5 Star-struck stars!!! 
 Wow!!! I'm absolutely blown away by Olivia Evans' debut novel! It's award season now in Hollywood and I can't think of a better time to dive into this engaging story. I am a huge fan of Hollywood romances and very few authors get it right. Hollywood and Vine is right up there with Love Unscripted and Eversea. I loved everything about this book, the insider peek into the movie business, scheming actresses, the nightmare of gossip magazines and paparazzi, and the difficulties of having a ""normal"" relationship in Hollywoodland. 
 ""She had no idea how he could be so infuriatingly perfect sometimes. How the man who caused her more hurt than she'd ever experienced still managed to make her ache for him."" 
 I thought this book would be a predictable insta-love sorry but I was so wrong! I fell in love with superstar actor Anders (even though he was a Grade A a**hole) and was absolutely taken with Josie's sass and smarts. I am still reeling from the ending of this book. Seriously, if you are looking for a story to pull you out of a book slump, Hollywood and Vine is it. It's got smoking hot sexy times, engaging and well-written characters and a fast-paced, unpredictable story. I hope Ms. Evans has more books planned because I can't wait to read more from her!",12,5,1,228,40.49,40.06,12.73,46.76,15.2,18.86,83.77,65.35,54.82,13.16,9.21,4.39,0.0,0.88,3.51,0.0,3.95,12.28,7.02,0.44,12.28,9.21,7.46,7.89,1.32,15.79,6.14,2.19,2.63,0.88,1.75,0.0,13.16,0.88,12.28,2.19,2.19,2.19,2.19,1.75,2.63,0.0,6.58,3.95,2.19,3.51,1.75,1.32,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,11.4,4.39,0.44,0.44,0.0,0.44,1.75,7.46,0.0,0.0,3.07,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.26,1.75,0.0,3.51,0.44,0.0,1.32,0.44,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,1.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,1.75,6.14,7.46,0.88,1.32,3.95,1.32,0.0,1.32,3.07,4.39,5.26,1.32,1.32,0.0,0.88,0.0,0.44,21.49,5.26,3.51,0.0,3.95,3.51,5.26,0
"Tessa Bailey is THE undisputed queen of dirty-talkers! Loved Bowen and Sera. 
 Risking It All is sexy, hot and has a thriller aspect to it! I loved the whole undercover cop story and my word, Bowen is HOT!! And that's saying a lot for a TB hero. He is right up there with the dirtiest-talking alphas EVER. This story is fact-paced, action-filled and has tons and tons of heat, tension and sexy times. TB's books literally melt your Kindle and Risking It All is one of her hottest books ever. 
 Favorite quote in the book: 
 ""We both know it's only a matter of time before I'm pounding the purity right out of you."" 
 RIA is a passionate mix of romance and action and I highly recommend it for all fans of Ms. Tessa Bailey!!

"Although this is the second book in the Half-Life series, I read it as a standalone and loved it. The characters mentioned in this book peaked my interest and now I will make sure to read Book 1! I loved this rough and intense look inside the music business. This is a sexy and gritty book, filled with raw sexuality and damaged characters. Krist and Madeline have both made painful choices in their pasts, and have had to suffer the consequences of their actions while living in the unforgiving glare of public spotlight. 
 Berng a rock star or ""pop princess"" is not all it's cracked up to be, and both Krist and Madeline struggle with broken hearts and loneliness. They are thrown together by their management in an afford at damage control for both their careers, and at first, they can't seem to stop hurting each other over and over again. The ""show"" they are putting on for the public is scorching HOT and they begin to realize that the heat and emotion between them might be very real. But will both of them be able to get past their mutual mistrust and broken hearts? The authors really deliver on the sexy times in this book and the birthday kiss scene is off the charts! 
 ""I don't know what's real anymore, but I'm not sure I care. When I'm touching you, it's the only time I don't feel like I'm drowning."" - Krist 
 One Kiss with a Rock Star is a great behind-the-scenes story about the life of rock stars. Being constantly in the media, being ""used"" by your label and management and sometimes by your bandmates, and not being able to really trust anyone all come with the territory. But Krist and Madeline love for the music and it is when they are on stage or performing that they truly feel alive. It is this deep bond that ultimately draws them together, and you hope will bond them together forever. 
 I absolutely love the writing duo of Amber Lin and Shari Slade. They really know how to create raw and beautiful scenes with their damaged characters. The emotion is real and the steam factor is HIGH. I highly recommended this book for all fans of rockstar romances.",2,4,1,377,44.76,37.02,43.66,39.55,18.85,16.18,85.41,70.29,57.29,13.53,8.75,3.18,0.0,1.06,0.0,4.51,4.77,15.38,7.16,1.06,12.47,9.28,4.24,9.28,1.59,16.18,5.84,2.65,3.71,1.86,0.8,1.06,11.41,1.33,10.08,2.12,1.33,0.53,2.92,2.12,2.92,0.0,7.69,4.24,2.92,4.24,1.33,2.39,0.0,0.0,1.33,0.0,9.55,3.18,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,6.1,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.27,0.27,0.0,0.0,3.45,0.53,0.0,2.92,0.27,0.0,1.86,0.53,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.27,0.53,0.27,0.53,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.27,5.84,9.28,0.8,0.8,4.77,0.8,0.53,2.12,3.98,2.12,7.16,1.86,0.27,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.0,13.79,4.51,2.92,0.27,0.53,2.39,3.18,0
"4 - 4.5 Sexy Stars!! 
 Delicious!!! DARK WILD NIGHT is a very sexy, very readable, fast-paced story about two friends who want to move out of the dreaded friend zone. I had forgotten how incredibly HOT and sexy Christina Lauren's stories can be!! OLIVER!! 
 Christina Lauren's stories are a book-crack addiction that I don't intend to give up! I didn't think I could love a couple any more than the other couples in this series but I was wrong. Oliver is sexy, sweet, romantic, and totally sensual and loving on top of it all!! No asshole-y-ness here, just a sexy-sweet, feel-good romance. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Lola, she's a total geek and totally adorable. These two are the only ones of their group of friends who didn't stay married after the shenanigans in Las Vegas. But they are close friends who don't want to ruin a good thing by becoming involved romantically. Even though I knew what was ultimately in store for these two, it still didn't put a damper on my enjoyment of this lushly-written yet totally modern story. 
 Oliver and Lola are two of the most ""real"" characters to date in this series. Lola is consumed with her work and Oliver backs off when she needs space. There is no unnecessary drama here, just two people who care deeply for each other, have smoking-hot chemistry but who have insecurities just like the rest of us. 
 ""I don't think I've ever loved anyone quite like this. In this sort of giddy, obliterating game-changing way. Where I can see myself with her for the rest of my life..."" 
 I feel in love with Oliver and can't wait for more yumminess from this awesome writing duo.

"Super-sexy, but very tender and funny short story featuring Max and Sara. A yummy story that Christina Lauren fans will devour! These two prove that parenthood is certainly not for the faint of heart but it can be beautiful, messy and filled to the brim with love.

"What a fresh and surprising story! Deliciously awkward, funny and sexy, Beautiful Secret is a fabulous addition to Christina Lauren's fantastic series of books. Niall Stella is irresistible!! He is stunning, sexy and smart, but he is definitely inexperienced when it comes to love, and his lack of self-confidence makes this book really different and very, very endearing. Ruby is hilarious and the cast of supporting characters is of course fabulous and make for lots of snappy banter. You will adore this book if you are a fan of Christina Lauren, and even if you've never read any of their books, this book definitely can be read as a standalone. Super-hot, funny and very fast-paced, Beautiful Secret hits all the high notes and is definitely a must-read!!

"4 - 4.5 stars!! 
 A story about hopes and dreams and finding love in the most unexpected of places. 
 Love books about musicians? Then don't miss Amber Johnson's Maybe, with the smoldering, brilliant Mace and the talented, smart and beautiful Emily. Firmly rooted in the music town of Austin, Texas, this story is an sexy, smart and poignant romance that will tug at your heartstrings. 
 I am totally swooning over Tyler Macy, who is so sensitive and gun-shy that he hands over the lead role in his band to another singer so he can retreat to the background. Enter Emily, a tough-on-the-outside journalist who doesn't want to love Tyler, but she does. She has her own dreams that took a backseat to her current profession, and wrestles with not letting anyone to close to her wounded heart. 
 ""When the memories of another time come flooding back too fast, I stop and drop gently to the floor, removing my shoes and lying on my back to stare at the ceiling. It wasn't a blown-out knee that had changed everything. The man I loved couldn't bear to see our promised future torn apart. I couldn't be who I'd set out to be, and he couldn't take the person I wanted to become instead."" 
 These two make an unlikely, damaged duo, but their chemistry is undeniable and their sexy times burn up the pages!! I was rooting for both of these incredibly fragile souls from the very beginning and Ms. Johnson makes their stories believable and their characters very, very real. The whole music scene and musician's life is very intoxicating and seductive, and is described very, very realistically. 
 ""I could have written an entire song in that bed with her, the notes were so loud. Tasting her and touching her? A symphony."" 
 This is a compelling, romantic and funny story and I highly recommend it to any fan of rock star romance!",8,4,1,319,39.52,49.38,4.52,95.72,16.79,19.75,83.39,65.83,54.23,14.73,10.03,3.45,0.31,0.31,3.76,1.25,4.7,16.93,7.52,0.94,10.97,7.84,5.64,8.15,2.19,12.85,6.9,2.19,2.51,1.25,0.63,0.94,11.6,0.31,11.29,0.63,1.57,2.82,1.25,1.57,2.51,0.31,5.96,5.96,0.0,1.88,1.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.48,4.08,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,1.88,9.09,0.0,0.0,2.82,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.13,1.57,0.31,0.94,0.0,0.31,2.51,0.63,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.63,0.31,0.0,0.31,0.94,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.96,8.78,0.31,1.25,4.7,0.63,1.57,0.63,2.82,2.82,4.7,0.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.44,5.02,6.27,0.63,1.57,2.82,3.13,0

"Beautiful and sexy and emotional! 
 ""I follow every part of you, everywhere. You go before me, Vera, you always will."" 
 Karina Halle has written a passionate, dramatic and very sexy story about two people deeply in love. This book is most definitely NOT a retelling of Love, in English, although I always love an alternate POV. Mateo is very sexy, very sensual, a little bit insecure and very, very human in this gorgeously written story. 
 ""She is mine, she is mine, I am hers."" 
 As much as Mateo and Vera are made for each other, nothing in life is perfect and love can be very messy and hurtful as much as it can be beautiful and life-affirming. And Mateo and Vera have some very complicated things to work through in this story. I loved reading about Mateo's relationship with his daughter in this book. The writing flows effortlessly, the story is flawless and I fell in love with Mateo all over again. Love, in Spanish has a very different tone from the first book and it is absolutely captivating. 
 ""I stared at myself in the mirror and didn't see a confident man in a sharp suit. I saw a little boy whose heart lay in someone else's hand."" 
 Love, in Spanish is another must-read book from one of my favorite authors. Don't miss this one!!

"4 sweetly emotional stars! 
 Under the Orange Moon is a classic second-chance romance, forcing on Dylan and Ben. Dylan grew up in a house full of brothers, and Ben was the best friend and practically a member of the Matthews' household. Poor Ben grew up in a very unhappy home and he and Dylan loved each other since they were children. But Ben is on the path to success, leaving home for college and then law school, after breaking Dylan's heart. 
 I really liked this sweet and funny story, it is beautifully written and I loved all of the lively family members that we are introduced to. The Matthews family is in stark contrast to Ben's family, with his cold and distant father and sad, sick mother. Ben seems to be a jerk at first but the author really gives us insight into his behavior and we can really understand his deep-seated issues. I loved Dylan and was really rooting for her and Ben! I also loved how the author created a very intelligent, talented character in Dylan and certainly did not make her a pushover. The highlight of this book for me was the incredibly warm family relationships. The characters all tied together nicely at the end and the Prologue was fabulous and very emotional. 
 This is the first book I have read from Adrienne Frances and it is perfect for fans of new adult, second chance romance!",2,4,1,239,67.8,69.31,13.86,95.32,18.38,19.25,84.1,66.95,53.97,9.21,6.69,2.51,1.26,0.0,2.51,0.42,2.51,15.48,8.79,1.67,12.13,6.69,5.44,9.62,0.42,11.3,10.04,2.51,7.95,5.86,1.26,0.84,10.04,0.84,9.21,1.67,1.26,0.42,1.26,2.93,2.09,0.0,10.04,7.53,1.67,5.02,2.93,1.26,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,11.3,2.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.84,8.79,1.67,0.84,1.26,2.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.35,0.0,1.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,1.26,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.42,3.35,8.37,0.0,0.42,6.28,0.42,0.0,0.84,2.09,6.28,4.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.3,4.18,3.77,0.0,1.26,1.26,0.84,0
"4.5 - 5 stars!! 
 TIGHT is another unexpected, gripping, very sexy story from Alessandra Torre. It is best that you don't read much about this book before going in, so that you can read it with a fresh eye. The plot is nothing that I expected and delivered a thrilling, one-two punch that came out of left field! 
 On its surface, the story is a contemporary erotic romance between Riley and Brett. They meet while she is attending a bachelorette party and like most books by Ms. Torre, there are other factors at play here that are lurking just below the surface. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, the sexy times are off the charts, and the action is heart-stopping and fast-paced. This is not a light-hearted book, it takes very dark turns but if you stick with this book you will be rewarded with a very satisfying ending. 
 Riley is a very strong heroine and Brett is unforgettable. And talk about the steam factor! SWOON! Tight is a fairly quick read, mostly because you won't be able to put it down. It does not contain huge twists but it does deliver an absolutely fantastic story with a very strong heroine and a totally swoon-worthy Alpha hero.

"4.5 HOT ROCKER STARS!! 
 Ann Lister's books have been on my TBR list forever. I was so excited to read LOOKING AT FOREVER and although it is part of a series, it is most definitely a standalone. However, I will definitely go back and read her other books! I fell in love with Rooster and Wheland and I want to read more about the other members of the band. 
 I absolutely loved this story, it has the perfect balance of off-the-charts steam (I mean, it is HOT!!) and engaging writing. The characters are completely appealing, I connect with both Rooster and Whelend from the beginning, and I am a sucker for rock star books. Add the M/M factor and this book was a total winner for me. The emotional AND physical connection between the two characters is incredible and real and their scenes together are scorching hot. 
 If you are looking for an addictive MM/M read with two very open, vulnerable but very masculine characters, then Looking At Forever is the book for you. Happy reading!

"4.5 stars!! 
 Pam Godwin is at the top of my list of favorite authors. Her dark and thrilling stories are among my most treasured books so I was absolutely thrilled to read a copy of Dirty Ties. I loved the crime/thriller/revenge twists in this story. As with all of Ms. Godwin's books, the characters are engaging, the story is twisted, and the steam factor is completely off the charts. 
 Kaci is highly educated, hard working and a loyal wife to Collin. Their unconventional marriage has led to a lonely life for Kaci and she is desperately seeking the intimacy that is missing from with her husband. Her fascination with the underground racing circuit in Chicago leads her to the mysterious ""Evader"", a man who has plenty of secrets himself. These two become enmeshed in a dangerous game that will certainly leave one the of them broken. 
 I love how Ms. Godwin always writes very strong heroines who aren't afraid to go after what they want. Her women are determined, smart and driven, and Kaci is no different. She might have met her match with a sexy man she meets one night, and these two together were absolute magic! 
 ""She was a wild card, and that fucking terrified me."" 
 Lightening up this dark and sexy story are some humorous moments which were a welcome relief from the intense storyline. I especially loved Kaci and Collin's interactions and Kaci's internal debates, especially when it came to the hot new guy she meets: 
 ""What about me?"" The possessive hand on my thigh clenched. ""Are you interested?"" 
 Oh, let me count the ways. And each one led to heartbreak."" 
 There were lots of twists and turns in this one! Loved the story. Dirty Ties is another great book from Pam Godwin!

"I loved The Resistance and couldn't wait to read The Redemption! This book can absolutely be read as a standalone; it follows the story of Rochelle and Dex, the drummer for the band The Resistance. This is a very emotional story - Rochelle has lost her soulmate Cory and she is still grieving for him and dealing with raising her two sons alone. 
 Dex is troubled and can't figure out how to get his life back on track. He is battling addictions and being in the public eye as well as his difficult family. But he loves Rochelle and can't stay away from her. These two have a tumultuous and passionate relationship and can't seem to stop hurting each other, even if unintentionally. 
 This book is about healing, acceptance and learning to move on even in the face of great pain and hurt. It's a great love story and has some very real, very honest characters who are doing the best they can with some heartbreaking circumstances. I really loved both Rochelle and Dex and loved this sexy and emotional story!

"4.5 stars!! Sexy, emotional, warm and very satisfying story. 
 Tia Louise's books have been on my TBR list forever and I am so glad I finally read One To Love! I LOVED it! Kenny and Slayde's story was filled with passion, heart, feeling, and incredibly hot and addictive sexy times. I love this author's style of writing, and can't wait to read more of her books. 
 Slayde is starting over in the small town where Kenny works as a trainer at a local gym. He is quite literally starting out at the bottom, working as a maintenance man and janitor at the gym. He hides his body so that his tattoos will not show, and he is trying very hard to keep his past hidden from the new friends he meets. And that includes Kenny. Even though she, too, has some secrets, Slayde feels unworthy of her and he is not quite ready to share his obviously painful past with her. 
 Kenny is very lonely and has almost given up on finding someone to share her life with. She, too, is hiding a painful past, but she has no idea about the man that Slayde used to be, or the incredibly damaging and heartbreaking actions he has taken. All she sees is the beautiful and damaged and humble man who has literally taken her breath away. Can the two of them learn to trust one another and open their hearts to love again? 
 This might sound like a theme that has been done many times before, but in the hands of Tia Louise, One to Love is a fabulously warm and sexy story about two very real and damaged people just trying to find love and live an honest and fulfilling life. Simple needs, really. Give this author a try. I couldn't put One to Love down and I can't wait to read the other books in this series. (This book contains characters from other stories but it absolutely can be read as a standalone.) Highly recommended!!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 A different spin on the contemporary romance story, the Royals adds in the fact that the hero is a member of England's monarchy. But he's a sexy, kinky royal, that's for sure, and that kept me turning the pages in this incredibly well-written and sexy story. 
 Alexander and Clara's saga continues right after Command Me, which I highly recommend as a hot, erotic romance. There is lots of drama to go around and lots of people conspiring to keep them apart. But Alexander knows what he wants, even if he can't quite reveal his heart to Clara in the way that she had hoped. But the chemistry between them is explosive and Ms. Lee is an amazing erotic romance writer! You will need a cold shower nearby! 
 There are dark secrets from their pasts that might permanently break them apart. Will Alexander stand up to his father, the King of England? I loved the glimpses into the royal life and I adored the London setting. I truly felt transported to the famous sights and sounds of London and del that this book was very different from most contemporary romances out there now. There are glimpses of Alexander's POV in this book which really added to the story.

"4.5 stars!! 
 I read The Hurricane in one sitting and was completely surprised by this fantastic debut book!! This story went way beyond my expectations and I absolutely fell in love with Cormac O'Connell. This book is not a standard fighter romance, but instead takes its time developing the characters, their relationships and the secondary characters in this story. I loved it all! And I especially loved the British flavor to this book. 
 While this book has PLENTY of steam and sexy times, Emily and Cormac's relationship is not just based on sex - they start off slowly as friends, because she is literally scared of her own shadow and frightened of a relationship with a man. Emily McCarthy is sweet, quite, smart and anti-social. It takes Cormac, to me a gentle giant, to slowly bring her out of her shell. 
 ""Safe is boring."" 
 Emily is hard-working and paying her own way through University. She doesn't want to fall for Cormac but he takes things gradually, and vows to protect her no matter what. Eventually she learns to trust him and to let herself actually feel something for another person. 
 ""He was the loud to my quiet, the confidence to my shyness, the rage to my pain. Separately, we were broken and alone. Together, we were blissfully happy and complete and every time that we made love was a celebration."" 
 There is plenty of tension in this fast-paced story and I adored the secondary characters as well. The Hurricane is a stellar debut novel and I cannot wait to read more from this author!!

"4.5 - 5 hot and wild stars!! 
 How I love the writing duo of K.A. Merikan. I will read anything that these two write. And Tooth, OMG, I know he's gay, but I think he might be my new book boyfriend!! He's bearded, huge, tough and unexpectedly tender with Lucifer. But don't even ask where he got the nickname of Tooth! 
 Although this is the second book in a series, the books can be read as standalones. In The Devil's Ride, Tooth is ordered to protect the Club President's son and at first, it is a painful, unwanted chore. Luci is a brat and very out of the closet, very different than Tooth. But he is crazy about Tooth, even if a little scared of him, and even acts out so that Tooth will ""punish"" him. Although I absolutely adored the smexy times between these two, and they are SCORCHING HOT, I also loved the gritty and very violent look inside MC life. This is not a sugar-coated story at all. I loved the underlying story about a crime the MC is trying to solve. (Not for the faint of heart!) 
 I absolutely adored the slow-burn of Tooth and Luci's relationship. It made their love scenes together all the sweeter. And did I mention that K.A. Merikan can write some of the most erotic sex scenes out there? You will need a cold shower after reading The Devil's Ride!! I couldn't put this book down and I literally can't wait for the next book in this series.

"3.5 - 4 Stars!! 
 I enjoyed this hockey book a lot and recommend it for anyone who likes a good, hot sports story with a lot of heart. Alex is an incredibly gifted hockey player who comes from an abusive background which is now affecting his game and his relationship with his teammates. 
 As part of a penalty, he is required to volunteer at a local drug-abuse prevention program alongside the beautiful and selfless Sutton. She is different from the hockey groupies who throw themselves at him, but at first he is a total jerk to her. No matter. Sutton sees the wounded person inside and they begin to fall for each other, even as he tries to push her away emotionally. 
 ""I've been a prick far longer than I've been charming. You're seeing a new side to me, but you know the old is bound to come out."" 
 ""We all have days when our monsters come out, Alex. You're not going to scare me off if I see yours."" 
 Sutton is feisty and educated and sees through Alex's B.S. She, too, comes from a dysfunctional family but unlike Alex, she has a positive outlook and is very close to her family. Will she be able to bring out the best in Alex and help him overcome his past demons? This book has more layers than a typical sports romance story and the characters really grew on me. I loved the hockey scenes and the steam factor between these two is AMAZING. 
 I have one tiny issue with this story, and I have found that it is not just unique to this book. Why can't a heroine be on birth control because she doesn't want to get pregnant? Why does it have to be to regulate her periods? This did not affect my enjoyment of the book, I am just surprised to see this recur over and over again in books. Overall, I really like the author's writing style. Alex is a sweetly sexy story with a heroine who is no pushover. It is a quick, romantic read with a VERY satisfactory conclusion. I actually found myself tearing up near the end! I also LOVED the other team members and I know they will have some great stories, too.

"What do you get when you mix Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher together? A thrilling, fast-paced, GRIPPING and memorable story called Never Never. If you have ever read anything written by Colleen Hoover, you know you are getting rich characters, an unforgettable plot and just all around amazing stories. And Tarryn Fisher has an imagination that can't be rivaled! Ever read her The Love Me With Lies series? Amazing. And Never Never ranks right up there with these writers' best books. 
 From the first words of this book, I was left feeling like someone pulled the rug out from under me. This overall feeling of disorientation is vital to the story, and the authors pulled it off with great success. I sympathized with the characters, felt their confusion, and could not stop turning the pages! This isn't exactly a paranormal story, and I cannot wait to see where the story goes. This review is brief because this book is best read without knowing too much about the plot. It is highly imaginative, inventive and very, very different. Don't miss this one!!

"5 Compelling, Un-put-down-able Stars!! 
 ""I'd discovered sex at a really young age, completely by happenstance, and like music, it had touched a nerve with me. I still craved that feeling, that closeness, and I sought it out as often as I could. I wasn't picky about who I slept with--older, younger, attractive, homely, mothers, girlfriends, wives. Who they were didn't matter to me, I only cared that they were interested. That probably wasn't the best thing to admit, but it was the truth. Sex was a release for me. It made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself, made me feel connected to the world around me. And I needed to feel that way. My life was full of empty spaces."" 
 And so begins this unexpectedly sexy and compelling book told from Kellan Kyle's POV. Forget that you think you know Kellan and Kiera's story, Thoughtful is a fresh and emotional story and is an absolute must-read!! 
 This book is a tribute to the fantastic talent that is S.C. Stephens. Kellan's voice is very male, very original and very, very sexy! My heart once again ached for him as we were given a peak inside his head and inside his heart. This story gives us insight into Kellan and Kiera's undeniable attraction, the heartache they both experienced and some amazing sexy times between the two of them. It is painful but compelling and I could not put this book down. 
 ""For a brief second, I wondered what she really thought about me. Did she know anything about me besides my name and that I was in a band? Did she realize I screamed my heart out in my lyrics? Did she understand that my life left me feeling vacant inside? That I was so fucking lonely I almost couldn't stand myself? Would she want to know any of that? Or was the fact that I was a ""rock star"" enough for her? Like it was for all the other girls I'd slept with."" 
 I absolutely loved the music scenes and they are an integral part of this book. I literally swooned all over again reading Thoughtful. 
 ""When it was time for us to go play, a familiar feeling washed over me--anxiousness mixed with peace. As I walked up the steps to the stage worn with use, I felt the remnants of who I was melting off me. Onstage, none of my worries touched me. It was like I was a different person. Like I was acting, and yet I was being more truthful than I ever was off the stage. I bled my heart out while I was performing, not that many people truly noticed; they were too busy enjoying the showmanship to dig beneath the surface of the words. There was safety in the scrutiny, anonymity in the spotlight. I felt invincible up there. Just me and my guitar."" 
 The loneliness, the pain of first love...it is all here and more. Thoughtful is a must-read and I applaud the author for giving us an amazingly fresh and new look at the irresistible Kellan Kyle.

"I absolutely love rock star books. Rush can be read as a standalone but now I plan to read the author's debut book, Jag, after Cathy raved about it. Rush is gritty, sexy, rough and does not paint such a glamorous picture of the rock star life. 
 Rush and Jules, the manager for his band Pandemic Sorrow', clearly have an attraction to each other. But Rush can't stay away from almost every girl he comes in contact with. If he isn't a sex addict, I don't know who is! Jules is there for every show and sees the fans throwing themselves at Rush. He makes no apologies for his sexual appetite but definitely wants to be a better man for Jules. 
 If you like sexy, graphic, rock star books, with a little humor thrown in, then Rush is for you. There is some drug use here but the author doesn't sugar-coat any of the downsides to living the rock-and-roll lifestyle. I really liked Rush's POV and I loved seeing the other members of the band. I did not feel that I missed anything but jumping right in to this book. Oh, and the sexy bonus scene at the end? HOT!! 
 This is my first book by Stevie J. Cole and I love her writing style. I'm looking forward to the rest of the band's stories!!

"4.5 - 5 STARS 
 ""This is hardly love."" 
 ""Then it's hardly lust."" 
 ""Then we'll just call it us."" 
 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! TURBULENCE was perfectly DIRTY, funny and smart. I could not put it down. There are books that fulfill a certain reading mood, and this juicy story was just what I needed. I totally connected with Gillian and Jake, and more importantly, FELT their connection, too. 
 The chapter headings in this book are priceless and the story line was incredibly creative. Just when I thought the author was taking a predictable path, the plot veered off into unexpected territory. Our hero Jake is cold, distant and sarcastic, but boy can he fuck. He is a MACHINE. He has a woman waiting in every city. When our heroine Gillian meets him, they both agree to a strictly-sex arrangement. But of course you know that one of them is going to fall hard and get their heart broken. But it's what happens along the way that makes for a yummy, delicious, insanely addictive story. And oh my God, the sex in this book is burning hot. I mean this is totally NSFW, reading-under-the-covers kind of sex. 
 ""We'll always be fucking, Gillian"" He smiled, biting my lip before tossing me onto the bed. ""That's the best part of us."" 
 This book would have been 5 stars for me except for some minor details. It might seem clever to name characters after real authors, but to me, it cheapens the story. Many readers will recognize one of the main characters in this book but again, that detail lessened the impact of the story to me. Finally, proofreading would have helped to correct certain inconsistencies in the story.

"If you have not had the pleasure of reading a book by K. Bromberg, what are you waiting for? Each book I read by this author is filled with warmth, a great story, amazing sexy times and fantastic characters. The Driven series is among my all-time favorite series and if you have not yet read Colton and Rylee's story, run, don't walk, to read those books. SWEET ACHE is a continuation of the story of one of the characters from the Driven series but can absolutely be read as a standalone. 
 Quinlan Westin is a smart, driven and feisty heroine, just like all of Ms. Bromberg's female characters. She is Colton Donavan's sister and yes, he and Rylee do make an appearance in this book. But the story belongs to Quin and Hawkin Play, the famous rock star who is sexy, tortured, and much, much more than meets the eye. When these two first meet, sparks fly, but they must work together since Hark has been sentenced to community service hours in Quin's classroom. 
 Of course he pursues Quinlan from the first time he sets his sights on her, but Sweet Ache is much more than a typical contemporary romance story. Hawkin is a wildly successful musician but he can't quite accept his fame and the adoration of his fans. He has a dysfunctional family dynamic and a twin brother who has sabotaged his every move. A misguided sense of family leads to Hawking taking the blame for one of his brother's misdeeds, which lands him as a guest lecturer in one of Quinlan's classes. 
 The banter between these two is priceless and the guitar pick scene might be one of my favorite scenes ever! Oh my lord. Epic. 
 ""There's just something about him aside from the whole I'm a rock-star thing, that makes me desire him in a way I can't put into words."" 
 I must admit that I was skeptical of Hawkin Play at first, his cockiness knew no bounds but once his story was revealed, I was rooting for him to do the right thing and finally put his own happiness first instead of constantly trying to take care of everyone else. There are lots of twists and turns to this story and once again, Ms. Bromberg delivers a gorgeous and sexy story filled with memorable characters and a satisfying conclusion. I love that family always plays such an important role in this author's books and Sweet Ache is no exception. I am positively addicted to this author's writing and can't wait for her next book! 
 ""Hey, Quin?"" 
 She looks down to meet my gaze. Her cheeks are flushed, her bottom lip is tugged between her teeth, and her eyes are hazy with desire. 
 ""This studio is soundproof. Make sure you scream when you come.""

"PURE PERFECTION!! 
 I could read only Kristen Ashley books and be very happy. RIDE STEADY is another slam-dunk winner from the Queen of Alphas, with a story that ripped my heart out and characters that I won't soon forget. Joker might be one Ms. Ashley's most unforgettable Alphas ever, a man who rose from a painful and loveless childhood to become a patched-in Brother of the Chaos MC. Chaos became his family, and the MC recognized the fire burning in Joker that would serve the club well. 
 ""He was at the shop window, empty pockets, face pressed to the glass, starin' at what he wanted but couldn't have. I'll wager, to survive, he's banked that fire. We gotta help him direct it and make sure if it flares bright, it doesn't burn him out."" 
 Carissa Teodoro's life becomes entwined with Joker's, as the two former high school classmates meet again years later. Let me just say that this book is so incredibly gripping and heartbreaking and sexy, that I am tempted to re-read it to experience these feelings all over again! She was once the golden girl who had it all, and he was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Their story spans years and that is what I love about Ms. Ashley's writing: there is no Insta-love here, instead, our hero and heroine have a shared history that adds a depth and richness to this book. 
 ""Yeah, Carrie,"" he answered. ""It's you. It's always been you. It'll always be you. Fuckin' always."" 
 Joker is a sexy, bad-ass Alpha biker that has zero interest in relationships, or in real friendships for that matter, since he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his feelings or his past. That is what makes his relationship with Carrie so poignant: this is a man who is so closed off and afraid of emotional bonds that he has been alone (and lonely) most of his life. 
 Carrie draws his out just by being herself. She is going through a messy and painful divorce, has a baby, is struggling to make ends meet and has a ton of emotional baggage. She is not perfect but she is open to love and gives her heart unconditionally to Joker. 
 ""Rule,"" he stated instantaneously. 
 His strange word made me blink at the lockers. ""Sorry?"" 
 ""Rule. You can't be like that on the phone. You can only be like that when I can kiss you."" 
 I lifted a hand and pressed it to the cold steel of my locker, leaning into it because my knees suddenly wouldn't support me. 
 ""You hear me?"" he asked. ""Yes, Joker."" 
 OH. EM. GEE!! *SWOON* I can't say enough about Ride Steady. Plus some of my favorite bad-ass Alphas from Ms. Ashley's other books make appearances here! Dead. There is also a sneak peek at the next Chaos book at the end of Ride Steady and it sounds amazing. Joker and Carissa's story is beautiful, thrilling and passionate. Ride Steady is a must-read! 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""Butterfly, you're cute all the time, cuter some times more than others, and it's fucked up because right now you're bein' a pain in the ass and this is one of those times that you're cuter. But you gotta get this so you can get over it. My old man doesn't exist for me. I left him and that life behind, and I don't want it back in any way it can come back.""

"Locke is the last book in the Corps Security Series. Although each book can be read as a standalone, the series is fantastic and you really get a sense of the strong camaraderie and history between the characters if you read the series. It is hard to say goodbye to these beloved characters but Harper Sloan does in in style with Locke. 
 Locke has a horrible relationship with his family as does Emmy, each in a different way. They both suffer terrible emotional (and physical) abuse. Locke has been convinced by his family that he is worthless, evil, bad, etc., so it is no wonder that he believes he has nothing to offer anyone, let alone Emmy. 
 Emmy has always loved Locke and when these two finally get together, it's the usual hot and fiery Corps-Security, bad-ass Alpha way! Locke won't let anyone or anything harm his Emmy and she helps him finally confront his own personal demons. 
 This is a fast-paced, really sexy and hot read. I love this series and fell in love with all the Corps Security men. Locke's family felt a little over the top to me, almost cartoonish in their behavior but other than that, I loved this book and highly recommend it.

"Skye Warren is my go-to author for dark, sexy, richly-written erotica. Annika Martin is a new author to me and now I want to read all of her books, too! As with all of Skye's books, the hero Grayson (yes, he is a hero to me) is darkly sexy, dangerous, forbidden and completely overpowering. He knows his power and attraction and he uses it against those weaker than him. Unfortunately it is a survival skill he learned at a very young age. Abigail meets him in prison when she is picked to teach a writing course to the inmates. But very quickly she realizes that Grayson is dangerously attractive, untrustworthy and dishonest. Or is he? 
 This book literally kept be turning the pages until the middle of the night. There is no right and wrong in this book, only two extremely damaged and vulnerable people who quickly become the target of a massive manhunt. Prisoner takes one thrilling turn after another, and Abigail, who fought Grayson with all her might, slowly realizes that all is not as it seems. 
 I loved Abigail's bravery in the face of absolute and complete danger. At first it seems as though Grayson would just as soon kill her than f*** her. But as with all for Skye's books (and I will assume Annika's books as well), this intensely sexual man is struggling with his own inner demons. Grayson makes no apologies for his actions. But will he and Abby survive all of the forces out to destroy them. 
 I couldn't put this book down. The prose is perfect and the story thrilling, sexy and even tender and heartbreaking at times. It is told in alternating point-of-views which gives great insight into Grayson's motivations. I was devastated to see this story end and I can only hope that the authors intend to write more stories including Grayson's crew. I absolutely loved Prisoner. It is gritty, raw, sexy, very layered and nuanced.

"4.5 stars!! 
 Another H*O*T story from Tessa Bailey! Oliver Preston is YUMMY. We first met him book one of the Serve series, Owned by Fate, as Caroline's playboy brother. (Each book, though, is a standalone story, which is another reason why i love this author.) Oliver is growing tired of the same old scene and is looking for something more meaningful than the constant parade of meaningless hookups. And Caroline's best friend Eliza happens to need someone to teach her the ropes of the BDSM scene, so to speak, in an effort to please a man she has just met. 
 Oliver and Eliza agree to just three lessons, nothing permanent, because they both think the other is not interested in anything long-term. But Oliver has secretly lusted after Eliza for years, while she thinks she is too inexperienced for Oliver and his wild playboy ways. Oliver is totally dominant in the bedroom and knows exactly how to please Eliza. 
 ""My palm is dying to make contact with your ass. Don't give me an excuse."" 
 I loved Eliza, she was a modern woman, confident and assertive but totally submissive in the bedroom. Oliver was a complete surprise, a gorgeous, sexy man who secretly harbored lots of insecurities and felt inadequate in certain areas outside the bedroom. Eliza really brought out the best in him and I absolutely loved these two together. Exposed by Fate is another completely enjoyable, very sexy read from the queen of the dirty talkers, Tessa Bailey.

"6 STARS!!! 
 ""...the problem with books is that they end. They seduce you. They spread their legs to you and pull you inside. And you go deep and leave your possessions and your ties to the world at the door and you like it inside and you don't want for your possessions or your ties and then, the book evaporates."" 
 Every word, every line of this book is PERFECT. I have never been so creeped out, or laughed so hard. I'm obsessed with Joe Goldberg! 
 Joe is obsessed with Beck. But I mean, hack into her email, stalk her every move kind of obsessed. And he is sick. Very, very sick. But that doesn't stop Caroline Kepnes from making him one of the funniest, creepiest, saddest, meanest and kindest characters of all time. He just wants Beck to love him. And that is no easy feat. Beck is at once smart, self-involved, funny, cruel and naive, but Joe is very, very determined. 
 ""You are a woman and I am a man and we belong in the dark together and you smell good, pure. I like that."" 
 This is not a romance but it is without a doubt one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Just when you think Joe has sunk to a new low, he goes even lower. He is perverted and weird and I am obsessed with him!! This book is filled with absolutely unforgettable characters. And the jokes about New York City living are the best. As is the sarcastic, witty and biting commentary on modern life in general. 
 I highlighted practically the entire book. I can't recommend YOU highly enough.

 If you're a fan of MC books, then you add this one to your must-read list!! It has it all, a strong, beautiful and spirited heroine, a tortured, complicated hero, tons of action and lots and lots of complicated plot twists and turns. 
 PURE IN THOUGHTS AND VENGEANCE. CORRUPT IN ALL THINGS THAT MATTER, and the symbolism of what he stood for. Biker. 
 I was on pins and needles from the first page of this book. I experienced the disorientation of our heroine, Sarah/Cleo, as she woke to the horrific reality of being held captive by a vicious MC gang. She feels a glimmer of recognition when she sees Arthur ""Kill"" Killian, but from where? When? I kept turning the pages to find the answers. Does Kill know her? Why is he so ruthless? There are so many to this story! Sarah/Cleo has lost her memory and her only clues to her past are tiny flashes of memories that come to her fleetingly. She feels a connection to Kill, but why? 
 ""I'm no one. And no one would've helped me. In my world--you survive or you die. You don't rely on others to make sure you do either one. It's the very first fucking lesson you learn."" The pain in his voice notched around my heart, squeezing. 
 I loved the small glimpses from Kill's POV. This book is a fantastic bundle of delicious mysteries all wrapped up in a sexy, dangerous biker package. Despite his hardened demeanor, Kill slowly allows himself to feel something for our heroine, all the while knowing his feelings could be the end of him. 
 For the first time in my godforsaken life, I felt... felt something instead of the cold hatred of vengeance. It gave me strength all while making me weak. I wanted more. Therefore, I had to stop. Before she destroyed me--just like all the rest. 
 Pepper Winters made me feel sorry for Kill, despite his outwardly vicious demeanor. This was a man who had suffered terribly and been horribly mistreated. But by whom? Many answers are revealed but I am definitely craving more. 
 ""I'd been spoon-fed lies all my life. I'd become a master at smelling untruths. And the woman currently residing in my home--the woman who'd healed me -- smelled terrifyingly toxic. A scent that made me want to run with one heartbeat and then fuck her with the next. She made me face things I was no longer strong enough to face. She made me look past her scam and crave."" 
 RUIN & RULE is told through a series of flashbacks interwoven with the present-day story. Pepper Winters is the mistress of a gripping and intense story and this one is no exception. Just when I though I knew what the outcome would be, she proved me wrong. RUIN & RULE is also a STUNNINGLY beautiful love story and succeeds as a romance on every level. There is a twist at the end and I cannot wait to get the next chapter in Kill and Cleo's story!!

"Debt is one of the darkest, most erotic books I have ever read. This story is not for the faint of heart so heed the warnings, but if you are ready for a stunning, thrilling, twisted and emotional story, then Debt is for you. 
 A suspenseful and revenge-filled tale, Debt had me on the edge of my seat from the first page. I highlighted so much of this book that I could fill this review with amazing passages but read it for yourself and experience this fantastic and sexy story. I have never read a book by Nina Jones and she absolutely blew me away by this story. 
 ""This man is my stalker, my terrorizer, my lover."" 
 Told in flashbacks and in alternating POV's, Debt is a story about Tax Draconi, who has come to settle an old debt from Mia Tibbett. He at first appears to be filled with hate, revenge and basically, with pure evil. His actions throughout much of the book are absolutely unforgivable. But the author is an absolute genius at making me actually love Tax and empathize with him. The scenes with Mia are beyond explicit. Tax brings new meaning to the phrase ""dirty talker"". 
 ""It's what I do when it comes to women. I can't give them affection, or love, or intimacy. That all died in me long ago. So I give what I can: Relief. Pleasure. Abandon."" 
 The focus of his plan is Mia, who remains mostly clueless about why Tax hates her so much, but still finds herself powerless under his erotic spell. He owns her, body and soul. She realizes that he has ruined her for other men and despite his evil ways, she still feels compelled to try to break through his wicked exterior. 
 ""Is it possible Tax could be everything I need in a man? He has the fire that burns me and awakens me. That was the thing I had been looking for, and it is so uniquely hard to find."" 
 The trauma that Tax and his twin sister Jude suffered at a young age is hinted at throughout the story and when finally revealed, sheds light on his behavior and Jude's thirst for revenge against Mia as well. This book might shock you but the story flows and the characters are unforgettable. I found a few minor inconsistencies with the story which in no way took away from my enjoyment of this dark, sexy. erotic, dark and fantastic story. I was distraught that Debt ended and I am waiting not-so-patiently for more from Ms. Nina G. Jones!

"What a passionate and intense love story!! Broken Juliet is THE perfect ending to Cassie and Ethan's epic journey. 
 I loved this book because it mixes both love and heartbreak seamlessly. I was so wrapped up in Cassie and Ethan's grand love story that I was thrown completely off-balance (just like Cassie!) when things would go wrong. And I loved every single minute of it!! The author once again switched between both past and present here, and while the back-and-forth can be jarring in some books, it worked perfectly here. 
 Broken Juliet picks up literally right where Bad Romeo ended. Ethan has broken Cassie's heart more than once and he is begging her for another chance. Cassie has finally moved on with her life and cannot believe that Ethan has finally changed and is open to really love her. One of the many, many things that I loved about this book is that it mixes in plenty of humor with the heartbreak and passion. Cassie is tentatively letting Ethan back into her life but she is trying her best to move slowly so her heart doesn't get trampled once again. Her inner monologue can be hilarious: 
 ""I can't drive. Is it cool for me to sleep on the couch?"" 
 No. Get out before I mount you. 
 Broken Juliet is a heart-pounding, passionate love story above all else. Leisa's writing is flawless and the chemistry between her two main characters absolutely off the charts. I was so connected with Ethan and Cassie that I was on the edge of my seat reading this book. And when Ethan gives Cassie his journals to read? Perfection. Cassie finally understands what was going on inside Ethan's head when he left her in drama school years before. These two share a passion and a love that is undeniable and absolutely breathtaking: 
 ""This man represents so many things to me. He was my first true friend. My first love. First lover. The master of more pleasure than I knew existed, and the architect of more heartache than I thought I could endure."" 
 I also really loved the behind-the-scenes look into the world of theatre. I appreciated the author's insights into the world of stage actors and the acting process. Some of my favorite scenes take place when Ethan and Cassie are in drama school, these are soul-baring, painful and beautiful passages to read. I can't recommend this series highly enough and I am totally addicted to Ethan Holt!! Both books are out now, so get reading! 
 4.5 passionate and heart-pounding stars!! 
 Favorite quotes: 
 The thing about developing an addiction is that it happens so quietly, you don't know how much trouble you're in until it's too late. It tiptoes through the rooms of your mind and body, gently inserting hooks and strings into every cell, until you don't know where you end and it begins. And untangling that web is nearly impossible. 
 This is more than lust. It's even more than love. It's imperative. Mindless, bloody-minded need. I can't kiss him deep enough, or hold him close enough.

"5 perfect stars!!! 
 Well. Where do I begin? Bad Romeo is one of my favorite books of the year. It is the perfect blend of coming-of-age, intense longing, heartache, friendship and first love. The story is told in a mix of present-day and flashbacks which can be confusing but work perfectly here. Ethan Holt is the classic bad-boy, who smashed Cassie Taylor's heart when they were drama students. Flash-forward to present day, when they are both cast as the leads in a Broadway play. Told from Cassie's point of view, the book follows their completely tortured, angst-filled relationship. But don't be scared away: this book is raunchy, laugh-out-loud funny and will keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next. 
 Can Cassie work with Ethan again after what he did to her in the past? She can't seem to stay away from him and Leisa Rayven gives a wonderful, slow-build story that kept me reading until the wee hours of the night. I was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes look at the theatre world and the sometimes-painful description of the acting process. And even though this is a New Adult novel, it is incredibly sexy and steamy and filled with just the right blend of longing and sexual release. And Cassie, what a fantastic heroine! She's smart, tough-on-the-outside but very vulnerable, and funny as hell. I fell in love with Ethan Holt and even though he was portrayed as a jerk, felt sympathetic towards him because of his tortured past. I can't say enough about this book!! 
 After I finished this book, I was fascinated to read that it originally began as fan fiction. How did I not know this? I am now officially addicted to this series and this author. I highlighted practically the entire book. The ending was perfection and I am literally counting the days until the next book, Broken Juliet!!

"3.5 stars!! Consensual tackles some very sensitive subjects served up with a side of some very, very steamy sex scenes. Braelynn is a very hard working law student who lands a prestigious internship and finds herself working on a major case. Push past the very dirty talk that occurs very early on in the story and you will actually get to an interesting storyline with two very engaging characters. 
 Peyton Haas is the opposing counsel on the case that Braelynn is working on. I had to take a step back here from the legal part of storyline involving the case, but the plot is very interesting and filled with lots of twists and turns. The chemistry between Peyton and Braelynn is fantastic and he actually has a soft and sweet side to him, to balance out his very strong, sexy and overpowering ways. It could be extremely detrimental to Braelynn's future legal career to become involved with him, but she finds him irresistible and he is very relentless in his pursuit of her. 
 There are LOTS of hot scenes in this book and it ends with a twist. The book is surprisingly enjoyable as it unfolds and I would recommend it to others. Peyton Haas really grew on me and I am looking forward to the next book in this series.

"4.5 stars!! 
 Looking for a different kind of story, but one with scorching hot sex scenes and a strong heroine? Read Uncivilized now! I was completely unprepared to fall in love with Zach but I did and I miss him already. There are some books that merely recite one sex scene after another, with no emotional connection between the characters and writing that fails to connect the reader with the characters. Well, not Uncivilized. Ms. Bennett has written a sensitive, interesting, very different story with absolutely memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time. 
 Zach at first comes across as a somewhat cold, savage man who will never become acclimated to the modern world. But is that such a bad thing? As the story progresses, Moira becomes more willing to bend towards Zach's way of life and his belief system. And this man is HOT HOT HOT. The book's sex scenes are absolutely among the most gorgeous, lush and loving scenes I have ever read. 
 This book could have been a cliche but it's most definitely not. I loved the world created by Ms. Bennett and I highly recommend Uncivilized. Enjoy! And have a freezer nearby!

"3 1/2 stars!! 
 Dark. Dark. Dark. Those were my first thoughts upon finishing Raze. I love a good dark and gritty romance and Raze fits the bill. This book is filled with intense drama and brutal scenes of torture so be warned. I have a very strong threshold for dark reads, but there was an extra element that didn't quite sit well with me. That being said, this book has an incredibly creative storyline and some hot, steamy, passionate and over-the-top sex scenes that are alone worth reading the book for. 
 This story is told in flashbacks. Raze was brutally ripped from his home as a teenager and subjected to all kinds of physical and mental abuse at the hands of an underground fighting ring. He loses his memories of his family and his childhood and literally turns into a fighting machine, bent on revenge against the monster who put him away. These scenes in the underground are difficult, tough and gritty. 
 Raze has the vaguest memories of a girl who is Kisa, the daughter of a New York Russsian mobster. She, too, is condemned to a live of confinement as the fiancee of Alik, a sadisitic, brutal and controlling fighter. The stage is set for her past and her present to collide. Will she able to save Raze from almost-certain death? Will Raze ever remember Kisa, the only girl he ever loved? 
 ""I've seen too many bad things with these eyes. This, I will feel in my heart."" 
 There are scenes of incredible beauty in this book along with scenes so brutal they are difficult to get through. But all in all, this story kept me turning the pages to see where these characters' journeys would take them. I was cheering for Kisa to stand up to Alik and rooting for Raze to be able to find the peace he so desperately needed. If you like gritty fighter stories, then Raze is the book for you!",6,4,1,328,68.88,56.43,8.83,4.02,13.67,17.07,84.76,66.46,53.66,12.5,8.23,2.74,0.0,0.61,3.66,0.61,4.27,15.55,7.32,1.22,14.63,7.62,4.88,6.71,0.3,13.72,7.62,1.83,3.66,0.91,1.52,1.22,9.15,2.74,6.4,1.22,0.3,0.61,1.22,0.3,1.83,1.22,8.84,3.35,5.49,2.44,1.22,1.22,0.0,0.3,0.0,0.0,13.11,5.79,0.0,0.0,3.05,0.0,1.83,7.01,0.61,0.3,2.44,2.44,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.3,2.13,0.0,0.3,1.52,0.3,0.0,2.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,0.3,0.61,0.0,0.61,0.61,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.3,3.66,10.67,0.3,0.91,6.1,2.44,0.0,0.61,2.13,4.57,4.88,0.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.94,6.1,4.57,0.61,0.91,0.91,1.83,0
"3.5 stars! Love this series. This novella is right after ""No In Between"" and must be read in order. The author gives us Mark's viewpoint which was absent while reading Chris and Sara's story. This whole series is one of my favorites and I highly recommend starting this series if you haven't read them yet...smart, sexy, adult and very twisty. Lisa Renee Jones draws you into these characters and you can't wait to see what happens next. 
 I loved seeing this side of Mark and I absolutely loved seeing Crystal's viewpoint. He may have just met his match. This is a very short story and is a great introduction to the upcoming ""I Belong to You."" Finally, I do not recommend reading this as a standalone but instead should be read as part of this fantastic series. Can't wait for more of Mark's POV!

"3.5 stars!!! I absolutely LOVED Sweet Addiction, the first book in this series, which I highly recommend. Book Two continues the story of Reese and Dylan, and the author delivers another steamy, delicious and frothy confection of a story. There are tons of HOT and dirty sex scenes to satisfy every romance reader and lots of witty banter between all of the characters in this story. 
 Sweet Possession follows baker Dylan as she prepares for her wedding to gorgeous accountant Reese, so we get lots of family drama, wedding jitters and super-hot and scorching sex scenes between dirty-talking Reese and his love, Dylan. It is great fun seeing them progress from a wedding hook-up to a devoted, madly-in-love couple. This book is a quick, hot, funny and yummy read from an author who I have come to love. You will love this story if you are looking for a sexy and fun read with great supporting characters!

"4.5 stars! I don't think I could love this author any more. Sexy, sweet, loving - - this book has it all. 
 Cardeno C. has become my go-to author when I want to read a sexy, beautiful m/m story that I know will be filled with heart, well-written characters and tons of emotion. The Half of Us is no exception. This is a hot, sweet and gorgeous story that I absolutely loved from beginning to end. Jason is hiding his loneliness behind a tough exterior and thinks he only deserves quick, one-night stands with nameless and faceless strangers. He feels guilty for breaking up his family when his wife divorced him, and has closed off his personal life from his kids. Even though his ex-wife told their kids long ago that their father was gay, Jase still feels uncomfortable forming any kind of lasting relationship with another man. 
 Abe thinks his hot night with Jase is just a one time thing, which is something he normally doesn't do. Abe is a traditional relationship guy. But when they get together again, Abe thinks that maybe Jase will recognize that they are really meant for each other. These two have some SCORCHING hot sex scenes together and I absolutely loved watching Jase's love for Abe slowly unfold throughout the story. Seeing Abe really care for Jase's children also brought tears to my eyes. These two really made a family together, and that is the real heart of this story. Treat yourself to a fantastic, beautifully written and sexy story and read The Half of Us. You will love it!

"4.5 stars!! 
 Let Love Be was a fantastic surprise for me - a gorgeous, sexy, heartfelt story about two people who have suffered losses and endured heartbreak in their past. I absolutely fell in love with Evan and even Lucy a little bit and devoured is book! Melissa Collins is a new author to me and has now become a favorite. 
 I love books about people in their forties and this is what Let Love Be is all about (Evan is even a little but older). Lucy has a college-age daughter, lives alone and Evan was a NYC firefighter who is also painfully lonely. I have not read the previous books in this series, and I absolutely jumped right in without missing a beat. With that said, I plan to read this series because I LOVE this author's writing! 
 Melissa Collins did a fantastic job in making me feel an emotional connection to her characters. I literally was holding my breath at certain parts of the book. The love scenes are incredibly hot and yes, breathtaking! There is no insta-love here and I love that the main characters are not only a bit older, but have regular jobs, normal loves and great friends. 
 I loved everything about this book. It is a good old-fashioned love story with a healthy dose of steam. Melissa Collins is incredibly talented and I highly recommend this book!

"Can you imagine having your boss discover a stash of pornographic pictures on your computer? Your worst nightmare, right? Well, that's pretty much what happen to Liese Harper at her new school and to say she is horrified, well, that's an understatement. Good thing her boss is a hot-as-hell, sexy and somewhat domineering man who is just as hot for Liese as she is for him. But can they keep their incredibly hot chemistry and lustful thoughts under wraps so that their jobs will not be in jeopardy? 
 I fell in love with Ryder and absolutely loved his internal struggle as he fought his overwhelming desire for Liese. He is a complete professional and does not want to jeopardize his position or Liese's professional reputation. The trouble is, he just can't stay away from her! 
 The Librarian Principle is a totally fun, sexy, romantic and well-written read that will keep you thoroughly entertained and ready to return to school! There is some emotional tension later in the story, and a little bit of danger but mostly this is a highly erotic, sweet and yes, very funny sexy story that is a prefect read when you want something adult and very, very steamy. Enjoy!

"Sexy and romantic! 
 (* ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.) 
 All or Nothing is the final books in the Love By Design series and it is most definitely a standalone! That being said, I am now going to read the first two books because I loved this romantic and very sexy story. This book is very funny, modern, totally hot and a great book to read when you want a true contemporary romance story. 
 Braydon is a hot supermodel and he and Ellie enter into an arrangement that is strictly sex only. Unlike the usual sex-to-love stories, this had some real drama, a great supporting cast of characters and an interesting plot that that takes the reader to some very exotic locales. 
 Braydon is very honest right from the beginning about what he wants from Ellie. The problem is, how can she not fall totally in love with this gorgeous, sensitive, sexy, and yes, SWEET guy who has obviously been badly hurt in the past? 
 This book will have you blushing and laughing and rooting for Ellie and Braydon to get past their stubbornness. All in all, a fun, sexy, sweet and romantic read from an author whose other books I can't wait to read!",1,4,1,209,58.06,40.06,9.84,99.0,19.0,16.27,88.52,76.08,55.98,10.53,5.26,1.44,0.0,0.96,1.44,0.48,5.26,18.18,9.09,0.96,10.53,7.66,6.7,7.18,1.44,14.35,14.83,4.31,1.91,1.91,0.0,0.0,11.48,2.39,9.09,0.96,0.96,1.91,0.48,2.39,2.39,0.0,11.48,10.53,0.96,3.83,2.87,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.57,5.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,2.39,4.31,0.0,0.0,0.48,1.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.31,0.48,0.0,3.83,0.0,0.0,3.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.39,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,5.74,7.18,0.0,1.44,3.83,0.0,0.0,1.91,4.31,3.35,6.7,1.91,0.48,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,14.35,3.35,6.22,0.48,1.44,0.48,2.39,0
"The Prince, Sylvain Reynard's novella, is darkly sexy, fascinating, and highly addictive. The author's writing is completely hypnotic and very powerful. The story is a wonderful introduction into the new Florentine Series, and features the stunning Professor Gabriel Emerson and his beloved Julianne. However, we meet a whole new set of characters in this very sexy, paranormal romance. I absolutely fell in love with the story! 
 The Prince is ruthless, cunning, and powerful. But what mysteries is the Prince hiding? And what secrets will he uncover? I can't wait to find out in The Raven. This story can be devoured in one sitting, and will leave you wanting more. The setting is broody and mysterious, and the bridge between the Gabriel Trilogy and the Florentine series is simply brilliant. I have sorely missed Sylvain Reynard and I anxiously await the The Raven!

"Another totally sexy, hot, sweet and incredibly poignant story from one of my favorite M/M authors, Cardeno C. This is a perfect book for any reader who might be new to the M/M genre and would like to ""get their toes wet"" so to speak. McFarland's Farm is a novella but it is yummy, filled with emotion, and oh yeah, some totally scorching hot sex scenes. 
 The scenes between Jared and Lucas are also filled with warmth and yes, love, and I felt a deeper connection to these two delicious characters than I did in many books 4 times the length of this story. 
 Spoiled, handsome Lucas is rude and disrespectful at first when he is first sent to stay with Jared and work on his organic produce farm in the tiny town of Hope, Arizona. Jared is a huge, very shy man who has been attracted to Lucas for years. What develops between these two misunderstood men is beautiful, steamy and very satisfying. 
 My one teeny tiny complaint is that I wanted MORE of this story! It was absolutely wonderful and I loved these two characters. I definitely recommend this book for all M/M fans and even for readers who don't normally try this genre. It's fantastic! 
 Totally sexy, poignant and filled with emotion! Beautifully written.

"I loved Scorned and couldn't wait to read Jealousy, and see who Jules would pick - Austin or Dylan? Although Dylan broke Jules' heart, he is totally swoon-worthy and I loved him in this book! But Austin... I really loved the way the author wrote this second book, it hooked me in right from the beginning. 
 In Jealously we are shown some of Dylan's side of the story. Because he seemed like the ""bad guy"" in Scorned, I really liked this. S.L. Scott is a wonderful writer and none of her characters are one-dimensional or cliched. I felt very emotionally connected to these characters and to the story and I can't wait for the final installment in this series.

"4.5 stars!! Another intelligently written, SMOKIN' hot story from the Queen of Dirty Talkers, Ms. Tessa Bailey. 
 Ms. Bailey is the best at writing a dirty-talking, in-control, delicious hero, and Jonah is just that. The owner of a private club, he finally meets his match in the smart journalist Caroline. She is judgmental and determined to hate his club and his lifestyle but once she gets a taste of both Jonah and his private desires, she is HOOKED. And so was I! 
 ""When was the last time you were properly fucked Caroline?"" ... ""Never. The answer is never, because I've never fucked you."" 
 Both characters grow, learn, change and love in OWNED by FATE. I feel that I can't go wrong when I pick up a Tessa Bailey novel. There is always a fabulous story, smoking hot sex, a smart and feisty heroine and a HOT and take-control Alpha hero. OWNED BY FATE is fast-paced and yes, even brought me to tears!! What?!

"Whatever you think you know about this book, you're wrong!! Filled with THE most amazing plot twists and gorgeous moments, November 9 literally took my breath away, This book is on my favorites lists, not just of 2015 but of all time. It is absolutely unforgettable!! 
 I read this book in one sitting and was absolutely devastated when it ended!! The writing is so perfect, the story is so creative and the characters are so vivid that I felt like a piece of me was missing was I finished this book. I felt like I knew Ben and Fallon personally, that's how expressive Colleen Hoover's writing is. 
 Fallon is damaged goods, growing up in Hollywood and having survived both emotional and physical trauma when she and Ben meet. 
 ""One of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars,"" she says. ""A lot of them even worse than mine. The only difference is that mine are visible and most people's aren't."" 
 Fallon and Ben are only teenagers when they first meet, literally on the eve of her big move to New York City. Could what Fallon feels for Ben be real and lasting? Only time will tell, as they make a pact to meet only once a year until she turns 23. No contact, no social media stalking, nothing, until their annual ""dates"". Fallon believes that this is the only way for her to be mature enough and self-reliant enough to be in a relationship with Ben. She is determined not to lose herself in a man. 
 But oh so much can happen in the time in between, and as the story unfolds from the past to the present, I began to realize what this book was really about. My heart broke for both Fallon and for Ben, and I was completely taken aback by the path this story took. 
 There are SO many memorable moments in this book, and they all took my breath away. Imagine think you have met your soul mate, only to see them once a year for the next few years! I wanted to scream at Fallon and Ben to grab onto their love and never let it go. 
 ""Please say yes. Please tell me you aren't finished falling in love with me yet."" 
 Don't miss November 9!! It is yet another flawless book from Colleen Hoover.

"4.5 stars!! Holy hotness! 
 The minute I saw Aleks Voinov's name in the acknowledgements, I knew I would LOVE this book, and I was right! His epic work Special Forces is one of my favorite books. Please heed the author warnings about Guns N' Boys, this is a dirrrrrrrty, homoerotic, violent crime thriller. But wow, what a ride! This book grabbed me from the first page an did not let go. 
 Seth is the son of a crime lord and is rescued and secreted home by the irresistibly sexy, dangerous and dominant Domenico. The two were childhood friends but hadn't seen or spoken to each other in years. 
 ""Domenico was the human equivalent of his motorbike. Fast and dangerous, yet impossible to resist taking a ride on, even at the risk of getting hurt."" 
 This book is a fast-paced, super-sexy, graphic and very intense story of two men in a forbidden relationship. Seth and Dom could not be more different, but yet find themselves drawn to each other. They must hide their relationship, and the underlying tension between these two had me on the edge of my seat. 
 There is a fantastic surprise for fans of the Dark Souls series!! Even if you haven't read the series, you will love the character of Sylvio. Guns N' Boys is a super-hot, incredibly well-written, steamy thriller. If you want to move outside your comfort zone and you love M/M books, then I highly recommend Guns n' Boys. There will be more books in this series and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment!

"If you are looking for an easy, very funny, no-holds-barred read, Playing It Safe is for you. Julia has a dirty mouth, speaks her mind and is just an all-around likable, relatable heroine. She suffers through bad dates (haven't we all?) and is just very down-to-earth and REAL. Barbie Bohrman seems to be a very funny lady and her humor is contagious! And I loved Alex, he is super-hot (hello! Backwards baseball cap!) And this book is totally hot, too - the steam factor was an unexpected surprise for me and I absolutely loved these two together! 
 There are lots of very likable characters in this book and the Epilogue was fabulous. If you are looking for a fairly angst-free book, with some sweet romance and completely hot sex scenes, then Playing It Safe is for you.

"The Space Between is the second book in a series about the Walsh family, but it is most definitely a standalone! This is my first Kate Canterbary book and I loved it! This book literally had me laughing out loud at the snappy, dirty, funny dialogue. I adore Kate's style of writing, it is fast-paced, highly detailed and very, very funny. 
 This series is about a large group of siblings. The Space Between focuses on Patrick, a well-known architect with a tough reputation. Andy is smart, driven and YOUNG but determined to win a coveted internship at the Walsh family architecture firm. These two clashed from the beginning but this book is about so much more -- family relationships, how they can define you well into your adult life, relationships with friends, and balancing work and professional life. Oh and the sex scenes? OFF-THE-CHARTS steamy and HOT HOT HOT!! Patrick is a dirty-talker with the best of the them! And Andy holds her own with Patrick, especially after she's had a few and let's go of some of her inhibitions. Their text message exchanges are priceless! 
 ""02:12 Andy: you said you wanted to tie me up, is that the sort of thing a girl has to request in advance, kind of like how you have to call ahead for Peking duck?"" 
 I loved the alternating POV's of Patrick and Andy. I also applaud the other for not just ""touching"" on the subject of architects. Many books will use a setting such as a law firm or architecture school, and then barely ever mention the setting or background again. Not Kate Canterbary. The Space Between delves into the architect profession and the subject matter with gusto and with intelligence. As a reader, I appreciate the detail! 
 The Space Between is a witty, very sexy and ultimately heartwarming tale about family, friends and love. I absolutely love the title of the book and how it ties in to the story of the Walsh family. Highly recommended for readers of sexy, funny and very romantic stories. I can't to read more books about the fabulous Walsh family!

"One of the most savagely beautiful love stories I've ever read. Kate and Jaylee's story is intensely raw and shocking and I couldn't tear myself away! 
 Mara White is a thought-provoking, challenging and amazingly talented writer. She deserves wide acclaim for her gritty, uanpolagetic brand of fiction. FEAR OF HEIGHTS made me cry, cringe and yell at Kate's roller-coaster ride of a life. This story must be read after Heights of Desire, which is one of my favorite books. Both will challenge you and make you re-think what you believe is right and what is wrong. Nothing is black and white in the Heightsbound series, that's for sure. 
 If you are a fan of gritty, raw, adult erotica, this book is for you. Fear of Heights picks up after the rather surprising ending of Heights of Desire, and literally takes you on a breathtaking ride of twists and turns, love and hate, regret and happiness, and shame and pride. Is that enough emotion for you? The author has done a spectacular job of painting a picture of Kate, a woman who seems to make all the wrong choices, but who is compelled on her course of action, consequences be damned. This is not an easy read, but it is a very adult story, and some of you might hate Kate in the end. I did not. 
 There is a ton of raw sex in this book, but the dialogue and the action is so well-wrtiten, that the book is elevated above most books in this genre. We get to know Ideal in this book, who at first seems unredeemable, but who I grew to kind of like by the end. And Jaylee, who Kate is obsessed with in the first book, once again broke my heart, with his raw vulnerability and open sexuality. 
 Fear of Heights literally made me yell at my Kindle. Books don't often provoke such a strong reaction in me, but Ms. White is such a talented writer that I can""t help myself! 
 This is not a typical romance, and deals with some very heavy themes. The plot is twisty and surprising and that is why this review is vague. This book is best experienced first-hand. If you are a fan of gritty, sexy, intensely emotional books, then Fear of Heights is a must-read. Bravo, Ms. White!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 WHOA!! Ricochet was un-putdownable!! Very, very dark, violent and sexy. Loved the fast-paced story. Great book for dark romance fans. 
 Told in dual POV's, Ricochet pulled me in from the first page and was one of those books that I could not put down. The storyline is very fresh, very original and very, very violent and dark. Which I totally loved. 
 Nick is hell-bent on the revenge of his family's violent death and Aubree is a pawn in his scheme. But she is trapped in a hellish world of her own, in a marriage to a sadistic, powerful man from whom she is all to relieved to escape. 
 Even before Nick abducts her, Aubree is fascinated with a mysterious masked man who warns Detroit's ruling elite that the city's criminal element is coming down: 
 ""I'd become obsessed with him just the same. Behind that mask was a mastermind of the most notorious computer hacks the city had ever known. His bold threats, his willingness to take on my psychopathic husband, had turned him into my own personal fantasy. 
 Is Nick the same, myserious dark avenger? Ricochet is not your average dark-romance kidnap story. Nick is cruel to Aubree but she slowly becomes obsessed with him, and he with her. Even though she started out as just a faceless pawn in his game. 
 ""I'd fallen in lust with a complete stranger, strictly on the basis that he happened to scare the shit out of my husband. 
 Aubree sees the hurt and pain behind Nick's rage and he slowly realizes that Aubree has suffered as well: 
 ""I saw darkness in her beauty, and she saw beauty in my darkness. Yin and yang. Black and white. Beauty and scars; fury and forgiveness. She should've been my nemesis, but in her, I found something I didn't know I was looking for."" 
 The law of the streets rule in this book and the action is gritty and unrelenting. And there is a HUGE twist at the end that I did not see coming. Ricochet is a great fast-paced, emotional, gritty and VERY sexy read that I highly recommend.",13,5,1,355,54.91,40.06,20.2,16.99,13.15,18.31,83.94,67.04,54.65,14.65,11.55,4.51,0.0,0.28,6.2,0.0,3.1,15.49,7.32,0.85,12.96,7.61,5.07,6.76,1.13,14.08,6.48,1.69,3.94,1.69,0.0,2.25,8.17,0.56,7.61,1.69,0.28,1.13,0.56,0.28,3.1,0.0,9.01,3.94,4.23,3.94,0.56,3.1,0.28,1.97,0.0,0.56,12.96,3.94,0.28,0.0,1.13,0.85,1.13,9.01,1.13,0.0,3.1,4.23,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.28,1.97,0.56,0.0,1.13,0.0,0.28,1.69,0.28,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.85,0.0,0.28,0.0,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.0,0.0,1.13,1.13,2.25,14.93,1.69,3.1,6.76,4.23,0.0,0.56,1.69,6.48,5.07,0.0,0.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28,19.72,6.76,5.07,0.28,1.69,2.54,3.38,0
"4.5 stars!!! 
 Cathy and I read this book together which has become a rarity lately! We both loved this book and found it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story filled with amazing and memorable characters. And Gus, hello!! What an amazing guy!! Perfect. He's loyal, sexy, honest, hard-working and always there for Kate. 
 This book tackles some very sensitive subjects so this will be a completely spoiler-free review. Kate is very funny, tough on the outside, and gives a lesson in what's important in life to just about everyone she meets. Cathy is not a huge fan of mature young adult novels and even she loved this one! 
 ""Katie didn't just look on the bright side, she lived there."" 
 And let's not forget Keller. We loved Kate with Keller! Once their slow-build relationship picked up steam, they were irresistible together. The alternating POV's told in the form of diary entries worked great in this book and really gave great insight into each of the character's state of mind. Keller grew emotionally and matured over the course of the story which was a beautiful thing to see. 
 ""Just when you think you know someone, they change. Or you change. Or maybe you both change. And that changes everything."" 
 I loved the book and would have really adored more steamy scenes between Keller and Kate. Cathy would have liked a little deeper exploration into the music scene. But we both loved Bright Side and think that Ms. Holden is an amazingly talented writer. 
 There are many secrets in this book and you will really enjoy it much more if you don't know what they are. This book will make you laugh, cry and and get lost in the story. Don't miss this one. And we are doing a happy dance because it looks like Gus will be getting his own story next year! SQUEEE!!

"WHEN I FALL is the perfect contemporary romance for me! Sometimes you read a book that is the right story at the right time with all the right characters and emotions. That happened to me when I read this book. It can be read as a standalone book, and is my favorite so far. I am a huge fan of SWEET ADDICTION and this book is now tied as my favorite J. Daniels book! Reed and Beth's story is sweet, insanely hot, immensely readable and just plain enjoyable. 
 Reed appeared earlier in the series as Tessa's best friend. He only does one-night stands, for good reason, but this is not a cliche story. J. Daniels puts a fresh spin on his story, and there are some totally laugh-out-loud moments in this book, along with some of the HOTTEST sex scenes I have ever read. Reed Tennyson is a dirty talker and I loved every minute!! And Beth is adorable, sweet, vulnerable, and the perfect match for Reed. 
 ""If I win,"" she says, ""I can choose to kiss you again, or, I can choose to do...whatever I want."" 
 Whatever she wants. 
 Option two. Please for the love of God, say option two. 
 I absolutely loved this book and loved the banter, the characters' back stories and the setting. There are no billionaires here, just a group of working people who happen to really care about each other and support each other. The chemistry between Reed and Beth is fantastic, and although the ending holds no surprises, the story is still the perfect mix of sexy and sweet. 
 ""Stories should feel real. Wanting something wild and romantic at the same time feels real to me. I think relationships need both. And it's not porn."" Our eyes meet. ""Porn doesn't make me cry."" 
 YES!! I adored this book!! If you are looking for a fast-paced, engrossing story, with plenty of sexy times, you will love WHEN I FALL!! And Reed Tennyson is all mine!!

"4.5 Stars!! 
 Sexy and totally addictive. Sustained is written in the unique Emma Chase style that I love! Ms. Chase ""returns to her roots"" in this super-sexy and funny story with lots of heart. 
 Ms. Chase really nails the male POV in SUSTAINED and she had me literally laughing out loud at Jake's inner monologue. He's a player, never letting his one-night stands stay past their first cup of morning coffee, and acting quite happy about the way his life is arranged. 
 ""If you're my date, stick to what will turn you on. I'm not a therapist or Prince Charming - and I don't pretend to be."" 
 Until Chelsea and her brood of six come crashing into his well-structured life, Jake never dreamed he'd be remotely interested in a relationship, let alone a ready-made family of six. Now I am not usually a fan of kids in my romance books. I have two big ones and let's just say I prefer a little escapism in my reading. But Ms. Chase makes the kids here such an integral part of the story that they were a delight to experience. There's no ridiculous babble or baby-talk but there are some tough scenes about raising teens, bullying and even just trying to find a moment alone with your significant other in the middle of chaos. 
 But SUSTAINED is at its best when Jake does the talking (or thinking!). Before he meets Chelsea, really all he wants is a warm body and some meaningless sex. A brief dry spell at the beginning of the story led to some of my favorite quotes: 
 ""...You and Hanna are going to be monogamous for a while."" 
 My eyes squint, 'cause I have no idea what he's saying. 
 ""Hanna who?"" 
 He waves his palm. ""Hanna Hand."" 
 Emma Chase writes some of best male POV's I have ever read. I absolutely loved how Jake evolved in this book from a callous playboy to a guy who realizes what's important in life. This book is expertly written, with a beautiful story, tons of steam and witty, fast-paced dialogue. Highly recommended!! 
 Favorite quote: 
 She frowns back. ""And you sound like you don't respect philosophy very much."" 
 ""All philosophical questions can be answered with one concise statement."" 
 Chelsea refills her glass. ""Which is?"" 
 ""'Who gives a fuck?'"" 
 She laughs, and it's an amazing sound.

"""We shy away from the things that hurt us - that have hurt us in the past. 
 That's what scars are for. They protect the wounds. Cover them with thick, numb tissue so we'll never have to fell that same pain again. The bottom of my stump is one big, hard callus"" 
 I absolutely adore Emma Chase! She is back with another super-sexy, witty and warm-hearted story that made me laugh at loud and tear up a bit. 
 Brent and Kennedy's story is sexy, funny, and completely endearing. Brent won me over and once again, Ms. Chase shows her skills at writing the male POV. 
 Brent Mason is a top lawyer and is totally surprised to see Kennedy Randolph again after many years. She was a sweet and nerdy girl who has now blossomed into a beautiful swan, who is also gorgeous, smart and his adversary in the courtroom. 
 Irresistible Brent sleeps around (a LOT) but never forgot his first love. Kennedy and Brent now face off in court in a high-profile case which added lots of opportunities for these two to really let the sparks fly. But it's the supporting cast of characters as well as the witty banter between these two that are central to this story. An interesting twist to the story is that Brent lost his leg in a childhood accident. He doesn't let this slow him down in ANY area of his life. This was a refreshing change of pace in an otherwise funny and sexy contemporary romance story. 
 Kennedy is scared of getting involved with Brent after all these years and the flashbacks to her teenage years, when she was bullied at school, are very poignant and form a stark contrast to the smart, successful attorney she is now. But Brent will stop at nothing to show Kennedy that she is the love of his life, and he is one determined guy! 
 ""...I collapse on top of her, my bones turned to Jell-o. 
 When the aftershocks eventually ebb, she laughs. That tinkling, magical laugh that sings of contentment and tugs up my own lips in a responding smile. 
 Now that - that is how you start a f-cking trial."" 
 Emma Chase's fans will eat this one up! Ms. Chase keeps up her winning streak with Appealed, a great entry in the Legal Briefs series. 
 ""Commitment isn't always a burden, Brent. It can also be the source of unimaginable joy and satisfaction.""

"3 - 3.5 Stars 
 Emma Chase is one of my favorite authors but this story just did not click with me. I am in the minority on this one so you should defintely give this one a try! Lots of readers LOVE Stanton. A few inconsistencies in the timeline interfered with my enjoyment of the book and I found some of characters to be Southern stereotypes. I also didn't really feel the emotional connection between Stanton and Sofia. I absolutely adore this talented author and will always read her books! Ms. Chase has a very funny way with her male characters which I love. Definitely looking forward to the next books in this series.

"6 stars!! 
 Magnificent and heart-stopping. This was my first reaction upon finishing Finding Eden, the continuation of Calder and Eden's story from Becoming Calder. Mia Sheridan has become one of my go-to favorite authors for creative story lines, heart-stopping emotion, and beautiful, glorious, sexy and REAL love scenes. 
 This will be a short review because both books should be read together and contain so many twists and turns, they are best read without knowing too much detail. Just know that the author answers all questions left open at the end of Becoming Calder, and delivers an incredibly satisfying conclusion for these two amazing characters. 
 Calder and Eden take an incredible journey and Ms. Sheridan lets you experience every heart-stopping second of it. Both books taken together are about staying strong, staying true to yourself even when everyone around you tells you something different, and overcoming incredible obstacles to find your one true love. 
 This isn't all hearts and flowers; there are some really steamy sex scenes along with some very brutal scenes of psychological and physical abuse. But the author really knows how to bring an epic love story to a wonderful conclusion and Finding Eden does all of that and more. 
 ""And we'll spend as much time as we need just escaping from the world. That's our plan because I swear to you, my beautiful, sweet love, everyone deserves a love story that doesn't hurt."" 
 In the end, Finding Eden is a story about forgiveness and learning to love yourself no matter what has happened to you in the past. Run, don't walk, to pick up a copy of both Becoming Calder and Finding Eden. Your life will be all the better for having read these books. 
 Favorite Quote (well, one of many!): 
 ""We have to figure out how to forgive, not for the people who wronged us, but for us. We can't keep bitterness attached to our hearts because eventually, it might become part of us--so deeply ingrained we can't work it back out. I think we have to focus on the beauty we've been given in this life, and make that the thing that defines us.""

"Loved! Ms. Scott's writing style is fantastic. Can't wait for more. Great story. 
 I am a huge fan of serials and I love S.L. Scott's writing, so I jumped at the chance to read her newest work. Jules had her heart broken by Dylan several years ago and this story is told in dual POV's. She is emotionally closed off because of the horribly painful break-up but seems like she might give love a chance again with the totally sexy Austin. 
 Jules has struggled to regain a normal like after Dylan abruptly broke up with her but she is thrown for a loop when he reappears in her carefully structured life. I love dual POV's and Ms. Scott nails it with Scorned. I can't wait to see whether Dylan's return will affect Jules' blossoming relationship with the handsome Austin. Will she let Austin into her heart or will she give Dylan another chance? I'll have to wait and see in Part Two of Scorned. I loved the first installment of this serial and can't wait for the next installment.

"Many readers loved this book but it just wasn't for me. I am a fan of dark romance, dark erotica, romantic thrillers, the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didn't connect with the main characters. I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story. I will read the author's other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.",2,3,1,100,28.63,1.43,41.95,98.42,25.0,21.0,91.0,70.0,60.0,14.0,11.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,17.0,9.0,1.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,8.0,2.0,13.0,7.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0
"I loved this book!! Pure enjoyment!! Love the humor, sexiness and behind-the-scenes look into the pop music business. 
 Brooklyn and Jason are forced to write and record a song together, but there's one tiny roadblock in their way - he can't stand her and she feels the same way about him! Jason is a broody, folksy musician whereas Brooklyn is a ""pop princess"". But she actually writes all of her own songs and is really a very warm, smart, funny, sarcastic woman who is lonely and wants to really experience love, not just write about it. Jason only sees the stereotype and is very judgmental toward her at first. 
 The Duet is very funny, witty, sexy and just plain un-put-downable. The author makes tons of pop culture references and give the reader lots of sneak peeks inside the business of producing popular music. The banter between Jason and Brooklyn is absolutely priceless and the story never sinks into sentimentality but instead stays fresh, modern and very, very witty. 
 Jason and Brooklyn begin a no-strings-attached sexual relationship which of course turns into much more for Brooklyn. I absolutely loved the sexy times between these two and I loved watching Jason's douche-y, ""asshole-ian"" (no, not a word!) facade slowly change. But he is hiding a whopper of a secret and I was sitting on the edge of my seat to see how this would play out. 
 The Duet is for sure a romantic comedy but it is much more. It is about accepting who you are, being true to yourself, always being honest and the importance of keeping your heart open to love. I love R.S. Grey and am totally excited to see that Brooklyn's sister Cammie, a brilliant architecture student, will be getting her own story with Grayson, one of Brooklyn's best friends!

"Great conclusion to Andrew and Aubrey's story in this surprisingly well-written installment. The emotions in the third installment of RD were deeper and the story was more detailed than the first two books in this series. I loved the characters. If you can suspend disbelief about working in a law firm, then you will love this series. Much of the legal part of the story was accurate enough, which was very refreshing. This series is a great, fairly fast read, filled with characters you love and characters you love to hate.

"I love books that give an alternate POV so Killer Queen was just the right story for me. You can absolutely read this as a standalone - but L.H. Cosway is such a talented writer that you should give Painted Faces a try, too. Nicholas is such a memorable and haunting character that I will always remember him. Beautiful, sexy, sensitive, angry and loving -- he is all these things and more. 
 ""I like to think of myself as a wonderful and unique snowflake."" 
 Killer Queen is basically Nicholas' POV along with some additional scenes. You really gain a lot of insight into Nicholas' character in this book and the Epilogue is absolutely fantastic. This is a very, very unique story - definitely not your standard contemporary romance - and it will change the way you look at gender and sexuality and men and women. I also loved the added touch of song lyrics at the beginning of each chapter to really match the tone of the story. 
 I love L.H. Cosway's writing and have every one of her books on my Kindle. Can't wait to read more by this incredibly gifted author.

"3.5 Stars 
 Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself.

"5 stars!!! 
 ""I squeezed him tight, because I already had what I wanted. Him. This. Us. Unfortunately, fantasies are for children and I was a grown woman. I should've known it wouldn't last."" 
 We are HUGE fans of Joanna Wylde's Reapers' Motorcycle Club series and Reaper's Stand might be our favorite book in the series so far! And that's saying a lot because each of these books are fantastic. But Picnic's story is grittier, edgier, meaner...and hello, we love that he is a bit older and has certainly lived a rough life. He has sex with loads of women since the death of his beloved wife, won't be tied down, but then meets London, who is a strong, independent woman. She has lots of burdens to bear and tries to make a go of things with out Picnic's help, but when these two get together...WOW. He's bad-ass, tough, sexy but funny and this story is one you just can't put down. 
 ""Just let me be strong for you for a minute, okay?"" He said softly. ""You've held on for a long time, sweetheart. Nobody can say you haven't been strong. But it's been a hell of a night, so why don't you let me hold you and help you right now, okay?"" 
 We found this book to be incredibly hot and sexy and much darker than most of the other books in this series. We absolutely loved these two together and Reaper's Stand is one of our favorite MC stories. It is violent but it is also real and the funny moments add some much-needed levity to the tense storyline. And the tease at the end...oh my lord!! The author gives us a peek at the next book in a new series and we cannot WAIT!!

"This book answers ALL the burning about what Colton was thinking during key scenes in the Driven Trilogy. Raced is totally hot and heartfelt at the same time!! This companion novella is a must-read for Driven fans. It shows not only the arrogant side of Colton, but also his vulnerable, tender, insecure and oh-so-sexy sides as well. 
 This book is almost like a love letter to Kristy Bromberg's fans and you can tell that the author takes that responsibility very seriously. If you were not totally in love with Colton Donavan before, you will be head over heels in love with him after reading Raced. I devoured this story and loved every single word of it. It is not simply a re-telling, but really gets inside Colton's head and is written in a true masculine voice. 
 I LOVED this book and highly recommend it!!

"3.5 hot stars!! 
 This book started off in one direction and then right in the middle veered wildly off into another! I asked myself ""WTF did I just read?"" after both but I did enjoy this book as a sexy, hot, fast-paced story. But it is not a standard sports or college romance story. 
 Part 1 tells Ashleigh, Camden, and Ryley's story. They are sexy, identical twins who are popular fighters. They are insanely hot and do NOT date or do relationships. They use women and then move on to the next conquest. They set their sights on Ashleigh and offer her a proposition - one night with each and then she can choose between them. This part of the book was scorching hot, funny, sexy and even a little sweet. The story did not go in the direction I thought it would and I was left stunned at the end of Part 1. I definitely want more of their story! I want to know much more about the brooding Camden and his relationship with his brother Ryley. 
 Surprisingly, the story then breaks into Part 2, which is Gabby's story. There are a lot of twists so just know that this part focuses on Tyler, Bradley and Gabby and is just as hot as Part 1 and funny, too. 
 I loved the fight scenes and really loved the sexy times with Ashleigh, Camden and Ryley. This is a fast-paced read that fans of college/new adult books will enjoy. There are lots of different points of view here but it was actually very insightful. Looking forward to reading more from this author!",0,4,1,271,39.92,16.5,62.84,66.75,13.55,13.65,90.41,71.96,56.09,12.55,7.75,3.32,0.0,0.0,1.48,2.58,4.8,14.76,5.9,2.58,11.44,7.38,5.9,10.33,1.11,12.92,8.86,7.75,1.85,1.48,0.0,0.37,11.81,0.0,11.81,1.85,0.37,1.48,0.74,1.11,6.64,0.0,6.27,4.06,1.11,2.58,1.48,0.37,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.37,12.18,5.17,0.0,0.0,0.74,0.0,3.32,6.64,0.37,0.0,1.11,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.58,0.37,0.0,2.21,0.0,0.0,1.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.48,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.06,9.96,0.74,1.11,5.54,0.74,0.0,1.85,4.43,3.69,4.06,0.37,0.37,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.5,5.9,4.43,0.37,1.85,0.74,2.21,0
"Stepbrother Dearest is, to put it simply, one of my favorite books this year. I am trying to avoid using the word epic here as it has been overused a bit, but this story took me on an incredible journey that left me nothing short of anxious, elated, enchanted and drained. Penelope Ward is hands down one of my favorite authors and this book is an absolute must read. 
 The story follows Greta and Elec who are step-siblings. But like all of Ms. Ward's books, there are many layers and nuances to this book and nothing is quite as it seems. 
 ""I won't give you exactly the same thing...but I can give you more. Okay? I can give you better. It may be one night, but I will make every second count."" 
 Although Elec is her stepbrother, I really didn't feel that Greta's love for him was forbidden. You will have to read the book and judge for yourself on that one. What I did feel was the incredible sexual tension, emotion, surprise, and yes, even humor in Ms. Ward's writing. 
 ""Nowadays, every single guy seemed to pale in comparison to Elec on the physical attraction meter. I wanted to crush that meter with a sledgehammer."" 
 Greta is smart, quirky, funny and compassionate. Elec is angry, cocky, sexy and irresistible. Slowly but surely, Greta begins to see behind his angry facade and they eventually form a deep bond. 
 ""... I thought about how ironic it was that this guy who'd done nothing but try to chase me away and intimidate me was the one person in the world I felt like I wanted to protect."" 
 But this is only in the first part of the book! In true Penelope Ward style, STEPBROTHER DEAREST is a richly woven tale that spans many years. The characters grow, move on, and the story almost loops back on itself. No spoilers here, just read this sexy, funny, emotional and fascinating story for yourself. And be prepared to have your heart stolen by Elec.

"4.5 scorching hot stars!! 
 This was my first book by Nalini Singh and it is a passionate, emotional, sexy and fulfilling story. I loved this book! The writing is incredibly sexy, beginning right from almost the first page when sexy-as-hell rock god Fox meets the shy librarian Molly at a party. It might sound cliched but the story is so well written, and the characters so well-developed, that I was drawn in immediately. 
 Molly has her reasons for staying out of the spotlight so a good part of the book is spent with her anquishing over stepping into the public arena with a world-famous musician. But she is powerless to resist Fox, a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. This book is fast-paced and takes the reader around the globe to New Zealand, Australia and California. And the supporting characters are fantastic, from Molly's best friend Charlotte to all of the other band members. Can't wait to read more about all these characters. 
 This was a wonderful story and the sex is incredibly HOT!! The book also created the oh-so-important emotional connection between the main characters. I also absolutely fell in love with Fox! This story is a must-read and is a great begninning to a new series. Highly recommended to all fans of contemporary romance.",0,5,1,220,74.86,42.73,12.64,98.85,14.67,20.91,82.73,68.18,53.64,9.09,4.09,1.82,0.0,0.0,1.82,0.0,5.0,19.09,11.36,1.36,12.27,7.27,6.36,8.18,0.45,13.18,10.0,3.64,4.09,2.27,0.91,0.91,7.27,1.36,5.91,0.91,0.45,0.91,0.91,1.36,2.27,0.0,8.18,7.27,0.0,3.18,2.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.91,5.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.73,5.0,0.0,0.91,1.36,0.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.55,0.91,0.0,2.73,0.45,0.45,1.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.45,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45,2.27,7.27,0.0,0.91,5.45,0.0,0.45,0.91,3.18,3.64,7.73,0.91,0.45,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,16.36,5.45,3.64,0.0,2.73,0.91,3.64,0
"WHOA!! What a ride! Fantastic story. To say it is unexpected is an understatement. Stayed up all night to finish. READ THIS BOOK! 
 These were my first thoughts upon finishing this book, an ARC of which was graciously provided by the author. Why was I on her ARC list? No clue. But I thank her from the bottom of my heart. This is an original story, with well-written, fully-developed characters, and clever twists and turns which forged a connection between the book and myself. Am I gushing? Yes. Because there are SO many books today that have cookie-cutter plots with cliche characters, I find it incredibly refreshing to come across a story like Black Lies. 
 There is no plot or character discussion here. Read the synopsis. That's all you need. Was this a 100% perfect story? No. But it is absolutely one of the best books I have read this year and I applaud Ms. Torre for her story.

"5 thrilling stars!!! 
 Gritty. Raw. Suspenseful. SEXY. Come take a wild ride through the author's City of Angels, and enjoy every second of the hot and thrilling rollercoaster ride. Antonio and Theresa got under my skin and I can't wait for even more of their story. 
 Ruin begins shortly after Spin ended. Theresa has become incredibly determined and strong and will do anything, ANYTHING, to protect and stay with Antonio. But he is lethal, dangerous and also determined to keep Theresa out of harm's way. Not an easy feat when the mafia is out ot get you and no one is to be trusted. 
 Theresa is still close to her family and Antonio ""Spin"" is acutely aware of that. But he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even when the things quite literally start to spin out of control. He tries to keep her isolated but she will have none of that and his carefully-crafted plans begin to quickly unravel and escalate to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. 
 This is an action-packed, super-hot and sexy story. The writing is gorgeous and spare. There are no flowery words, no gushing declarations in the world of Antonio Spinelli. But surprisingly, there is humor, which provides a welcome relief from the near-constant state of tension and almost primal sexual urges. Spin loves Theresa in his own way, and they are both completely obsessed with each other and cannot stay apart. 
 ""You're from a different world , but you smell like home to me. I haven't been to Napoli in ten years, but whenever you're near me, I smell olive flowers. My heart gets sick with thirst, and the water is poison."" 
 I can't stop thinking about Spin and Theresa. C.D. Reiss has become one of my favorite writers and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment in this series.

"This book is a beautifully written, very adult contemporary romance that uses gorgeous skydiving metaphors at the beginning of each chapter. SKYGODS took me on a fantastic journey with Samuel and Kaye through a tumultuous period on their lives and I read it in one day. The book contains a story-within-a-story as Samuel, a world-famous, best-selling author tries to write the real story of his and Kaye's life. 
 This is the second book in Sarah Latchaw's Hydraulic series and while SKYGODS can be read as a standalone, I recommend that Hydraulic Level 5 be read first to appreciate the depth of Samuel and Kaye's story. That being said, you can still revel in and enjoy this very unusual and offbeat love story without having read the first book. 
 Samuel and Kay have been divorced for years and re-connect once again. Kaye lives in Colorado and has her own PR firm. Samuel is touring to promote a movie based on his best-selling book. It is a life filled with press appearances, publicity, and many demands from outside forces, and Kaye can see Samuel slowly unraveling before her. 
 This story is really beautifully written and is refreshingly ""adult"". There is certainly no insta-connection as Samuel and Kaye make their way back to each other. You get the feeling they are always meant to be together, irrevocably and forever, but my heart was in my throat at several points in the story. Many secrets are revealed and true love does win out, and happily for me as a reader, the ending seems to be left open for much more of Samuel and Kaye's story. But their love is not without cost and they do not arrive at their togetherness easily. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Samuel in SKYGODS and was rooting for him the whole time I was reading. I loved reading about the PR side of the book publishing business, mental illness and skydiving, and I can't wait to read more from this author. 
 FAVORITE QUOTES: 
 But that's the way real love works, isn't it? It's not calculating or conditional, or self-serving. It doesn't subjugate another to the demands of one's happiness, but it rejoices when happiness is found. Especially when it's found hand-in-hand. Real love is placing your unmolded years in the palm of another and, despite circumstance, trusting them to shape it into something exquisite before they return it to you. And then you do the same for them because you love them. 
 Happiness; why is it that we frail beings turn happiness into something so unattainable? Happiness can be as simple as discovering the asparagus you hated as a child is quite tasty once you reach adulthood. It can be a shared, secret smile with a complete stranger in a grocery store line when they place chocolate, strawberries, and candles on the conveyor belt. Being grateful simply for a rain-soaked breeze cooling your face, soft grass under your feet, intricate veins weaving through a leaf. Or reveling in a strong, secure arm around your shoulders and just knowing, even though he hasn't voiced it, that you are completely and utterly loved.",0,4,1,523,42.3,49.15,44.81,96.31,19.37,21.03,85.85,67.5,55.83,12.81,7.65,1.91,0.19,2.29,1.15,2.1,5.16,14.72,6.5,1.34,13.0,8.6,5.93,9.75,1.53,15.49,5.16,4.4,3.25,1.15,0.76,1.34,11.47,0.57,10.9,1.72,1.15,1.15,1.34,1.91,4.02,0.0,6.5,6.31,0.19,3.82,3.63,0.19,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.0,12.05,5.16,0.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.91,6.5,0.19,0.0,0.38,0.76,0.19,0.19,0.0,0.0,2.49,0.19,0.0,1.91,0.57,0.0,3.06,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.19,0.19,0.57,5.35,9.18,0.19,1.15,7.07,0.57,0.0,0.57,3.82,3.25,6.69,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.19,0.0,0.0,15.68,4.78,5.16,0.38,0.0,2.29,3.06,0
"LOVED IT!!! Refreshingly funny, sweet and sexy! 
 The Stage Dive series is one of my favorite series and Lead is an absolute delight. Sexy, refreshingly funny and smart, Lead not only features the achingly beautiful Jimmy, it also introduces us to the fabulous Lena, who in my opinion could be every woman's new best friend. Honest, funny and real, Kylie Scott has written a completely relatable heroine who at times broke my heart and other times had me laughing at loud. 
 Lena knew that Jimmy would be her Achilles heel almost from the get-go when she is hired to be his assistant and sobriety companion. 
 ""Whatever else he might be, Jimmy Ferris was special and complicated, beautiful and beastly, all rolled into one. A natural-born performer."" 
 Lena struggles to fit in to the rest of the band dynamics and all the sexy couples of the Stage Dive family. She is tenacious, hilarious and completely turned on and attracted to Jimmy, but the real Jimmy, not the rock-star persona. 
 ""My heroin was six-foot-one and gorgeous as sin."" 
 Lena has had her share of heartache, and is afraid that Jimmy will steal her heart away while she is working as his assistant and stomp on it in the process. I absolutely loved how strong Lena was and how she really stayed true to herself and did not try to hide her true feelings for Jimmy. Will these two get their happy ending that they so desperately deserve? 
 ""Love was truly one of life's mysteries. That it could f@@@ you five ways to Sunday and still remain so utterly perplexing and unknown was kind of impressive. I guess."" 
 Lead is a fabulous summer read and Kylie Scott is one of my favorite writers. Enjoy Lead, you will fall in love with Jimmy!!

"I LOVED this funny, sexy romance from Amber L. Johnson! The story is fresh and creative and I absolutely fell in love with Andrew. What starts off as cute storyline turns into a lovely, sweet and very, very funny story about overworked Gwen, who is struggling to manage raising two young children on her own, and Andrew, a wealthy, seemingly carefree guy, who must get a job and really wants to become responsible and self-sufficient and please his cold and distant father. 
 Eight Days a Week is a fantastic ""lighter"" read, with an unexpected storyline and interesting characters. My heart ached for Andrew; he has spent his life trying to please his parents and live up to his ""perfect"" older sister. He sees his chance at redemption when he becomes ""manny"" for Gwen's young family and actually finds something he is very good at. The children love him and of course, he is madly attracted to Gwen. But they both decide not to pursue their insane chemistry for the sake of the children, because what would happen if they broke up? 
 Will these two be able to love each other and keep their new family together? I adore Amber Johnson's writing style and was laughing out loud as well as totally swooning many times during this book. The sexy times are HOT and Andrew really has it all: looks, brains and talent. What woman wouldn't fall for him?

"First, I was very pleasantly suprised at the steam factor in this book! And Thomas Maddox is a memorable character, that's for sure. 
 I really liked the romantic suspense aspect of this story, and I really admire the author for writing a strong female character. Oh look, it's okay to be a workaholic and be a professional! I am on board with female characters who are not just window-dressing or who do nothing but sorrt of flit around the story. But I digress. 
 Liis and Thomas do connect early on, but it really works in this book. Jamie can really write a steamy hot sex scene and I can't wait to read more of this from her!Liis is smart but she is pretty insecure in her personal life. 
 I'd gone from feeling sexy and desired to an embarassingly eager, cheap score. 
 Liis and Thomas must later work together as FBI agents and this aspect of the story was very fast-paced and interesting. Liis, like Thomas, is devoted to her work which has not left much time for a personal life. 
 ""Ah. You're married to the job. Betty Bureau."" 
 Thomas is a total hard-ass and has a notorious reputation for being impossible to work for. Will he soften for Liis? I loved seeing the other Maddox brothers make an appearance here, but make no mistake, this was Thomas' story through and through. This book is fast-paced, sexy, very romantic and a must-read for Jamie McGuire fans.

"4.5 pounding-hot stars!! Seriously thrilling and addictive. 
 This is the first book I have read by this writing duo and it certainly won't be the last! This is a gritty, thrilling and addictive story. Please note the series name - SEX and MAYHEM, and there's plenty of both! 
 This is a M/M Motorcycle Club book with a twist: Stitch, is a closeted gay biker. His MC is seriously homophobic and he is not out to his ex-wife or to his family. This guy is sex on a stick and and when he meets the sexy and alluring Zak, all bets are off. Zak is a tattoo artist and is completely out. They have explosive chemistry and these sex scenes are absolutely among the top 5 hottest scenes I have ever read. What begins as a sex-only relationship gradually builds into something more. Stitch grows as a character and little by little comes face to face with his own sexuality. 
 ""I had a bad night. All I wanted was to come home to you."" 
 Stitch and Zak have an intensely passionate relationship but Stitch still will not admit that he is gay. He imposes secrets and restrictions on Zak and Zak quite naturally rebels and much sex and mayhem ensues. I found this book to be incredibly gripping and the writing style fast-paced, gritty and intensely sexual. 
 Make no mistake, this book is incredibly violent and graphic. It is also filled with what I found to be highly erotic m/m sex and irresistible characters. I absolutely loved this very dark and emotional story and can't wait to read more from these authors!

"3.5 stars!! 
 This book has love, sex, great friends and a very feisty heroine who speaks her mind and is not afraid to take action and make mistakes along with way. One of the things I loved about this book was that Lexi really grows as a person throughout this story, going from waitress to pursuing a dream and making it happen. And Lukas is a total dream, hot, sexy, possessive, and not afraid to admit when he makes a mistake. 
 Some of the elements of this story were a little familiar to me (sexy millionaire, fancy cars and homes, etc.) but the writing is very honest and raw and that elevated this above lots of other books in this genre. And the sex is raw and beautiful and honest and loving. 
 Lexi is also a real, contemporary working woman who struggles with her family, job and love life. I also absolutely loved the detail about each city that the story takes place in, from Montreal to New York. I really enjoyed this book and yes, I do love gorgeous book covers and this one has a beautiful one. If you love a hot and sexy book with drama, a sexy, possessive hero, and lots of heart, My Most Precious One is for you.

"Fantastic debut from author Adriana Locke!!! This book is sexy, fast paced, warm and witty. I really enjoyed this book and read it almost in one sitting. The characters are very well written, very down to earth, and Cane Alexander is totally HOT and incredibly swoon-worthy! 
 Jada is trying for a fresh start after leaving a bad marriage. Swearing off ""players"", she is determined to be meaningful to someone and be cherished. Jada and Cane meet through her sister and they instantly connect. That sounds like the same old story but it's not. This is a very sexy, very relatable book with a healthy dose of suspense and action thrown in! Cane is a self-confessed ""player"" and tells Jada right from the start that he doesn't do relationships. But something about her has him re-thinking his ""bad boy"" status. 
 ""You shouldn't try to play games with me because I'm not a player, I'm the coach."" 
 ~ Cane 
 Cane and Jada have fabulous chemistry and because this book is told from dual POV's, it was great to experience what both characters were feeling. I also loved Cane's best friend Max and Jada's sister Kari, and of course hope that they will get their own story, too. Grab this one if you love a sexy Alpha male who is not afraid to go after what he wants and who will do anything he can to protect the ones he loves!

 Synopsis 
 My life, inside this apartment is simple. It works, as long as I follow the rules. 
 1. Don't leave the apartment. Not in case of fire, not to mail a letter, not to run an errand. The door stays shut, and I stay inside. 
 2. Don't get attached to clients. I take off my clothes, I stand in front of the camera, and I perform. What they want, I give. Their secrets, I keep. Everything I tell them, is a lie. 
 3. Don't kill anyone. I've obeyed that rule for over three years. 
 My life, inside this apartment was simple, and it worked. Then, I started breaking rules. 
 Enter a world of lies, thrills, fears, and all desires, in this original thriller from A. R. Torre. 
 Warning: This book contains explicit sexual references, and should not be read by anyone under the age of 18.

 5 Thrilling Stars!!! 
 I had been dying (ha) to read this book for a long time. I love dark reads and this sounded exactly like a story I would love. Remember if you are looking for a book about love and romance, this is not the story for you. Deanna is a sex ""web cam"" girl but is also a virgin. She locks herself away in her apartment with virtually no human interaction beyond her online interactions because she battles homicidal tendencies. She has her neighbor actually lock her in her own apartment at night so that she won't be able to give in to her urges. 
 A deliveryman becomes fascinated with this beautiful and strange girl who won't even open the door to retrieve her packages and Deanna and Jeremy begin a very strange but exciting relationship. Just when I though this book was going a certain way, it changed course and went down a completely different path. I was shocked, thrilled, fascinated and blown away by the ending of this book. 
 ""No one is normal. Everyone is just pretending to be normal."" 
 I absolutely loved how this story unfolded layer by layer. I was immediately pulled into this incredible story, and was fascinated by all of the characters, by some of their very dark natures, and by the interactions and internal dialogue that goes on inside Deanna's head. The setting and the thrilling storyline that unfolds stunned me and I felt compelled to know more.This book is a must-read, especially for fans of dark stories. There is plenty of sex, and even a little romance thrown in, but it is the shock and surprise at the characters and the story that make this an unforgettable book. 
 I want to thank the author for not only making unsympathetic characters believable, but for also writing this book that I will never forget.

"Suspenseful doesn't even begin to describe this book. DO NOT DISTURB is a thrilling, dark, sexy and fast-paced story with a twist! If you are looking for a dark, smart and erotic story, then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you. 
 This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN 6E, a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!! The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might, just might, be as dark and disturbed as she is. But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control (barely), this new character does not. He is plain evil. The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic. This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart. 
 Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client. Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her? Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy? Once again, the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions. The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic. I haven't stopped thinking about these characters! I amy dying (well, not literally) for another book in this series!! Don't miss DO NOT DISTURB, it is a must-read book that will keep you on the edge of your seat!!

"Wow! Break the Sky is a brilliant, rich and SCORCHING hot storm of a story that will make new fans of Nina Lane. Kelsey and Archer were seen in the earlier Spiral of Bliss books but you do NOT have to read those books first (although they are fantastic and I highly recommend reading them NOW!!) One of my favorite couples, Dean and Liv, make an appearance here but the center of this amazing book is the stormy relationship between Kelsey and Archer. 
 ""I swallowed to ease the dryness in my throat. 
 'Do you always let fate decisions for you?' 
 'Fate makes better decisions than I do.' "" 
 Archer has always been a screw-up, an angry (and rightfully so), rootless man, drifting from job to job and never able to commit to much. He rides into the town of Mirror Lake already a changed man but his brother Dean only sees the old Archer, the addict and the womanizer. Enter Kelsey, the tightly-wound meteorology professor who needs to let go a little, and who knows that Archer is everything she should avoid. 
 ""He could push me to my limits and protect me the entire time."" 
 Kelsey and Archer immediately strike a ""deal"", agreeing to a temporary relationship while he is visiting with Dean and Liv. Suffice it to say, they both get more than they bargained for and both learn to see behind the other's facade and get to what's real and honest. All of this plays out against the almost-fairytale-like setting of Mirror Lake, which adds a very special magic to this incredibly sexy and adult story. 
 I must say that I absolutely love how Nina Lane can write about the world of college academics on the one hand and then turn around give us one of the dirtiest-talking characters EVER! (Phone sex, hello!) Archer is all man, commanding, bossy and completely honest with Kelsey. I found their relationship to be completely real and perfectly developed. I also loved the way Archer and Dean's relationship grew throughout this story, and the way Archer really matured and came to terms with his past. 
 BREAK THE SKY is tender, sexy, funny and incredibly satisfying. Another must-read from Ms. Nina Lane!

"Boy in a Band is a poignant, emotional and very sexy story of Morgan and Matthew, who meet as 12 year olds and in the Seventies. This is an extremely nostalgic coming of age story that grabbed me by my heart from the first page and kept me spellbound until the very end. This book deserves wider acclaim and I hope that more readers will give this gorgeous story a chance! 
 Matthew is the quintessential bad boy, sexy and irresistible and unwilling to commit to one girl. Morgan loves him from the first time she lays eyes on him and her love for him spans decades. She keeps coming back even when Matthew is openly cruel to her, because they have an intense physical attraction and deep friendship that she is unable to ignore. 
 This isn't an ""insta-love"" story, but is instead a beautiful story that unfolds over many years, with plenty of steam and sexy times. There were times when I became incredibly frustrated with Morgan's choices but then Matthew would do something that showed his sensitive and loving side, and I actually sympathized with Morgan's actions. Boy in a Band is a rich and satisfying book filled with characters that I won't soon forget. Ms. Loomis is a very talented writer and I absolutely loved this poignant and emotional story!

"Super hot! 
 This is my first book by Sawyer Bennett and I absolutely loved it! Sugar on the Edge reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance. It has emotion, perfect pacing, a lovely locale (the Outer Banks of North Carolina), a character-driven story and BLAZING hot sex. Gavin and Savannah are memorable, real and totally drew me into their story. 
 I have not read the other books in the Last Call series so I can tell you that this one can absolutely be read as a standalone, but now that I have sampled Ms. Bennett's writing, I will read them. There are other characters from the previous books but they are fully-written characters and I did not feel as though I was lost at all. 
 Gavin is in a lot of emotional pain and moves to North Carolina to finish writing a manuscript. He's sexy, British and has a very dark side. Savannah seems at first to be his total opposite - sweet, hard-working, yet smart and a little sassy. I literally read this book in one sitting and recommend it as a perfect read if you want a hot, sexy, funny, exciting and emotional story. I highly recommend Sugar on the Edge and am adding Ms. Bennett's other books to my TBR list immediately. Enjoy!

"4.5 Stars! 
 Colleen Hoover is a must-read author for me. I always adore her books, the stories, the emotions, the characters, and Confess was no different. This book is pure magic, from the opening chapter to the very end. Confess is an intricately woven tale from beginning to end, where all of the characters are somehow connected and where everything is slowly revealed, little by little. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Owen. He is a gifted artist but has some very rocky relationships in his life. I just knew that I would grow to love him even though he seemed like he made some questionable choices early on in the book. Owen and Auburn are both very, very complicated characters and my heart nearly broke for Auburn and her situation. I could not put this story down and read it in practically one sitting. 
 ""I love you so much."" His voice is breathless and full of fear. ""I'll love you forever. Even when I can't."" My tears fall harder at his words. ""And I'll love you forever. Even when I shouldn't."" 
 You should read this book without any spoilers because the plot is very clever and there are surprises thrown in along the way. I love the creative plot and the paintings throughout the book are just magnificent. They tie into the story perfectly. I will confess that my ARC copy did not have the paintings so I bought a Kindle copy and I am so glad that I did. The paintings are haunting and very revealing. Even though this is a romantic story with some very emotional situations, there are definitely moments of humor which I greatly appreciated! 
 Confess is another must-read from one of my absolute favorite authors. It is a beautiful story about the power of trust and love and I didn't want Owen and Auburn's story to end.

"4.5 stars!! Wow, did not see that one coming. 
 This is N. Michaels' debut book and it is a great, sexy, escapist romance. I had this book on my TBR list forever and is getting a re-release after being its original release in 2013. I could not put this book down once I started and it is a very good twist on the office romance theme. 
 Katherine is not your run-of-the-mill heroine because she grew up in a very privileged family and never had to work. She lives in a gorgeous apartment in NYC and Her father is a famous neurosurgeon. However, he cuts her off after she refuses to follow in his footsteps. Although she is smart and talented in her own right, she doesn't have any work experience and must find a ""real"" job. She lands a position as the executive assistant to the CEO of a company. Eric Miller is gorgeous, sexy and very, very off-limit. I had a few minor issues with the plot at this point but nothing that detracted in a major way from my enjoyment of the story. 
 I absolutely loved the chemistry between Eric and Katherine! They literally can't stay away from each other. I must feel an emotional connection between the main characters and the author does a great job at creating that bond here. Katherine knows she is sexy and desirable but has really never felt the attraction for a man like she feels for Eric. But of course Eric has a bitchy ""friend"" named Eliza who will let nothing stand in her way of becoming Eric's girlfriend and she does everything in her power to come between Eric's growing attraction to Katherine. 
 I fell in love with Eric and loved when he showed his romantic side. I can't say much else about the story without giving any spoilers. Enjoy this story for what it is: a very hot, escapist romance, set between NYC and Miami with lots of drama and some very sweet and tender moments. I absolutely loved Eric and Katherine together and can't wait to read the next book. There is a rather dramatic cliffhanger but I am hoping that we won't have to wait too long for Book 2.

"Throttled is a sweet and sexy novella and companion to Throttle Me. City and Suzy are fantastic characters and I highly recommend the Men of Inked series if you haven't read them already! 
 All of the books focus on the Gallo family and are sexy, well-written books that are highly addictive. City is a dirty-talking, motorcycle riding ALPHA who falls for Suzy, a wonderful character who really blossoms under City's love. Oh, and did I mention City is pierced, too? Oh yes. Throttled focuses on these two and you need to have read the the other books in the series first. 
 City and Suzy have a misunderstanding in this story but all's well that ends well and I hope they appear in again in future stories. I absolutely love this series and recommend the books for anyone who loves strong men, great writing and fast-paced stories. Can't wait for the next book in this series, Resist Me!

"5 GLORIOUS STARS!!! 
 53 Letters for My Lover is one of those rare books that sweeps you off your feet, transports you to another world, and truly touches your soul. Laylah Attar absolutely blew me away with this wonderfully sexy, bittersweet tale of 2 people who seem to be destined to be together, yet spend years apart. 
 Shayda is an obedient wife and daughter, married to a damaged man to whom she is fiercely loyal. Their story is in itself raw and heartbreaking. She meets Troy, the sexy, brilliant man who she believes she can never truly have. 
 ""Dusty sneakers, grey sweatpants...and then--the most startling pair of blue eyes. They reminded me of the cut outs I had saved in my wish book, of the places I wanted to visit. Blue like the water that surrounds the islands in the South Pacific. I felt like I had been picked off the pavement and plopped smack dab in the middle of it. I floated there for a while, suspended in its endless horizons as it held me for long, still seconds."" 
 Troy is mesmerized by her exotic beauty and captivated by her innocence and naivete. These two begin a dance that spans decades and is gloriously and deliriously sexy and heartbreaking at the same time. I understood why Shayda could not let herself go and truly be happy but at the same time, I could not believe that these two could ever be apart from one another. Shayda is bound by her sense of honor and loyalty to her family, but is slowly suffocating under the weight of her obligations. Troy makes her truly feel alive for the first time in her life. 
 ""You have to stop running from the things that scare you, Shayda."" He fixes those dreamy eyes on me, ""The only way to feel truly alive is to start living fearlessly."" 
 I read this book in one sitting and was dying for more! Lucky for me, the author has written a companion novel from Troy's POV!! Leylah Attar is a magnificent storyteller. My heart was pounding, I had tears in my eyes, I laughed and I could not stop reading. Don't miss 53 Letters For My Lover. It is easily one of my favorite books this year.

"4 frothy and delicious stars!! Loved this swoony, very romantic story!! 
 I absolutely love Melanie Harlow's Frenched Series! The heroines are strong, witty, sexy and very relatable. Coco is thrown together with her ex, Nick, a well-known chef who broke her heart years before. She has never really gotten over him and it seems that even though he broke up with her, he isn't over her, either. Melanie French writes sexy heroes who have a heart of gold, a strong romantic streak and who aren't afraid of strong women. The sex scenes in this book are UBER-hot and sweetly romantic at the same time. 
 Sometimes you need a sexy, light and super-romantic book in between some of the darker, heavier reads, and Forked fits the bill perfectly. Put Nick and Coco on your reading menu, you won't be disappointed!

"My Hunger is book number 3.2 in the INSIDE OUT Series by Lisa Renee Jones. (This is a novella that should be read as part of the fantastic Inside Out series and is not a stand alone.) We absolutely LOVE this incredibly original series and it remains one of our favorite series - it's original, thrilling, sexy and very addictive. A must-read. As for My Hunger, we see Mark dealing with the traumatic events surrounding Rebecca's disappearance as well as his mother's illness. He is still deeply affected by Rebecca but is now drawn to Crystal Smith, one of his top employees. 
 I have always loved Mark and his controlling ways. He is attempting to become Master to Crystal but she is very different from his other submissives. Will he be able to fight their overwhelming attraction? 
 I loved their banter and sexual tension and Lisa Renee Jones is such a talented writer that she only makes me want more from Mark's POV. He is one of my favorite characters from the series. This is a fairly quick, very sexy read, and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!

"Indiscretion was a hot little detour from my regularly scheduled reading! Chloe and Max's story is a quick and easy read, funny, steamy and fast-paced. Chloe has a one-night stand (actually a hot quickie) with handsome Max at a club in New York City. They never thought they'd see each other again but they run into each other in her hometown of Bar Harbor, Maine. Elisabeth Grace has a sexy, breezy, enjoyable writing style and does the alternating POV very well.

"5++++ stars!!! 
 Once in a while, a book comes along that absolutely throws you for a loop and knocks your socks off and I'm happy to say LOCK & KEY is one of those books. A story about a 42-year-old heroine who has sacrificed her whole life to the One-Eyed Jacks MC, LOCK & KEY is hot, sexy, thrilling, perfectly written and filled with characters that I won't soon forget. 
 Grace and Lock meet right at the beginning of the story and sparks fly. They are both damaged and not looking to connect with another human being on any kind of meaningful level. They spend an incredibly HOT night together ((hello, ice cube scene!!), thinking they'll never see each other again, but boy, are they dead wrong. 
 I fell in love with Lock, he is one bad-ass biker but he knows a good thing is right in front of him. The problem is, will he realize what a treasure Grace is before she slips away? 
 ""I had my dream on my hands and in my mouth, and I never fucking realized."" 
 This story is perfectly told in both a combination of flashbacks and alternating POVs. The book unfolds like a flower petal, layer by layer peeled away until the reader is left incredibly satisfied at the end. This is a long and meaty book, filled with plenty of drama and scorching hot sex scenes, but I literally could not put it down until the very end. Ms. Porter has created a world of memorable characters, Alpha bikers, strong and feisty women and a solid story that will stay with me for a long time to come. 
 I highlighted half the book but instead I am ""borrowing"" the author's teasers. This is an original and very creative story so I don't want to give any of the plot away. Add Lock & Key to your TBR list immediately! This is a must-read book for all fans of strong writing, characters with backbone and beautiful stories about the importance of family and second-chance love. Ms. Porter deserves a place among Joanna Wylde, Madeline Sheehan and dare I say Ms. Kristen Ashley with her absolutely incredible debut MC romance book. Go meet Grace and Lock. I know you will be as captivated as I was.

"4 beautiful stars!! 
 ""Why the war paint, Pix?"" 
 ""Because I can't stand the girl underneath,"" she whispered 
 ""Why the tattoos?"" Lexi asked 
 ""Because I can't bear seeing the scars of my past."" 
 Tillie Cole is a very gifted writer and this story is fascinating, heartbreaking, beautiful, funny, tender and wonderfully written. This is not exactly your typical jock-meets-Goth-girl story, it is much richer and more nuanced than that, and I really recommend you give this book a try. 
 You do not need to have read the other books in the series (I did not but I plan to read them now) to follow Lexi and Austin's story. Austin is the star player on the University of Alabama's football team, and Lexi is part of the cheerleading squad. But he is also a tattooed, former gang member struggling to break free from his past. She, too, has her own painful struggles that are handled with incredible sensitivity and care by Tillie Cole. 
 There were many times during this book that I was afraid something terrible would happen to Austin or Lexi, and I read the story with my heart pounding. Austin is a beautiful boy inside and out and showed great compassion and caring for others, all hidden beneath his tattooed, tough-guy exterior. Lexi struggles to keep it together, even as all others see is an offbeat but talented cheerleader on a very tough college squad. 
 Sweet Fall is very much about not judging a book by its cover and not expecting others to conform to your idea of of ""perfect"". Acceptance, of both yourself and of others, is the message I took from this story and I applaud the author for writing about a very difficult and painful subject. I highly recommend Sweet Fall and I can guarantee you will fall in love with Austin Carillo!

"I am a HUGE fan of Raine Miller and The Blackstone Affair series. Her writing is intelligent, sexy and emotional and Cherry Girl is no exception. Cherry Girl is a romantic story of two people who have been in love for almost their entire lives. Neil and Elaina are pulled apart by circumstance but find themselves working together at Blackstone Security. This is an intensely romantic and emotional tale, but of course with all the elements I love from Raine Miller including of course scorching hot sex scenes! 
 One of my favorite characters ever makes a brief appearance here but Cherry Girl is a standalone story and you do not need to read The Blackstone Series before you read Neil and Elaina's story (but you should!!) I absolutely loved this story and highly recommend this book for all Raine Miller fans.

"Gorgeous story! A.L. Jackson does an amazing job of describing deep emotions and she does it again in the conclusion to Aly and Jared's story. Come to Me Softly perfectly describes the fears and conflicting feelings of two young people desperately in love, but really battling for each other because of their past hurts. I really love Jared, he is strong, brave and swoon-y. I absolutely loved the way he opened up to Aly. The beginning dragged just a little for me but the story really picked up and I'm glad I stuck with it. This is a great new adult story with plant of steam. Amy Jackson writes beautifully, and this story flowed perfectly toward a very satisfying conclusion. This is an emotional love story and even though I loved the ending, I was very sad to say goodbye to Jared and Aly!

"Saving Poughkeepsie wraps up the story of the brothers and the whole gang in the Poughkeepsie series. 
 Poughkeepsie was truly a book that changed my life. Debra Anastasia became one of my favorite authors and she does it again with Saving Poughkeepsie. This is not a typical love story. It's gritty, hilariously funny, violent, and yes, beautiful. All the brothers are here in all their glory. 
 All of the characters are very real and very flawed and you can't help but fall in love with them, even Beckett, the brute of a man who finally finds a woman who can tame him. I loved seeing Blake and Livia, Cole and Kyle, and all of their loving and living and trials and tribulations. These characters stay with you long after you read these books and I truly will miss this wild and gorgeous group. 
 The story took a minor detour about mid-way through which was surprising but did not detract from the book for me. Once again, the author has written a fast-paced tale which not only has elements of a crime thriller, it also is a romantic story filled with lots of heart and plenty of love. The dialogue is snappy, the banter between the characters is priceless, and the scenes are very, very real. 
 I am not quite ready to say goodbye to the brothers or the rest of the characters and I actually re-read most of the first two books while reading Saving Poughkeepsie. Please read this series. The books will absolutely enrich your life.

"Vanquish was not at all what I expected and is a painfully beautiful story of the redemptive power of love and devotion. Yes, I LOVE Van, and for those of you who have read Deliver, you know that he is twisted, really f*ed up and obsessively, possessively in love with Liv. He seemed BAD through and through but I knew better! I couldn't wait to read his story because I knew there was much more to him. 
 Vanquish totally blew me away. It is really a story of two painfully lonely people who really only want to connect with another human being on the most basic of levels. But this being a Pam Godwin story, well, you get two very effed up people, tons of mind-blowing sex, and lots of danger thrown into the mix. 
 Pam Godwin's writing is pure perfection. There is no insta-connection, the emotions are real and the sexual chemistry is explosive. This book has it all. And Amber broke my heart. I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and I will devour every book she writes. Vanquish is raw, gritty, beautiful, suspenseful, sexy and painful.

"What an adult, sexy and witty story! 
 Alice Clayton writes very realistic and humorous banter between Simon and Caroline and I laughed out loud through many parts of this book. An added plus is the incredible chemistry between these two and the sexy times are absolutely hot and very satisfying! This story is about real-life, Simon and Caroline have real-world professions and work hard just like lots of outer couples to make their passionate relationship work. Jobs, friends, family, and yes, even all-seeing Clive all intervene into their blissful existence. 
 I loved the way Simon and Caroline's relationship grows in this book. They learn more about each other and their witty banter is funny and realistic. Caroline has to make some tough decisions this book but all is done with good grace and humor. There is no over-the-top drama or contrived situations. But Simon is absolutely still gorgeous, sexy, romantic and swoon-wrothy and can still sweep Caroline off her feet. 
 I also loved all of the supporting characters, and Simon and Caroline's friends play a major role in Rusty Nailed. I can't wait to read more about them in upcoming books in this series. Rusty Nailed is everything you expect from Alice Clayton: intelligent, witty dialogue; steamy chemistry; and true love and caring not only between Simon and Caroline, but between all of their friends. I can't wait for Screwdrivered!

"If you are looking for a sexy, adult, emotionally-written novel, Arrest is for you. June Gray writes a beautiful portrait of the newly-married Elsie and Henry as they struggle though the challenges of their first year of marriage. Henry is a new law enforcement officer and Elsie is a rising star at her PR firm and although they are deeply in love, not everything is all hearts and flowers. 
 I loved this very sexy and a little angst-y story of two people who are bound to each other physically and emotionally but who face tons of uphill battles both from outside forces and from their own inner insecurities and turmoil. Although reading Disarm first is not a must, it is recommended so that you can really fully experience the journey that this couple takes. 
 Ms. Gray writes some incredibly hot and very loving sex scenes and I absolutely fell in love with Henry! This is a very sexy and very beautifully-written book about married life. Enjoy!

"Vi Keeland is a favorite author of mine and I was excited to read her young adult romance written with Dylan Scott. Both sweet and sexy at the same time, Left Behind is a wonderful story of loss, strength, emotion and first love. The story is very engaging and the characters are very real. Nikki and Zack's story totally drew me in, and once I started, I read this book in one sitting. 
 Told in alternating POV's, which actually become one story, Left Behind tells the story of Nikki, who relocates to California after the death of her mother. Having lived a very lonely and sad life, she is apprehensive about starting over. But Nikki is very strong because she had to grow up at an early age. She doesn't want anyone's pity and just wants to be a normal teenager. 
 To her eyes, Zack lives an almost-perfect life, with a stable family and seemingly happy home life. But Zack has faced a terrible tragedy and is dealing with it in his own way. Angry and guilt-stricken, he is confused over his feelings for Nikki. There is a twist to this story that wasn't really a surprise, but I was literally holding my breath through most of this book, hoping against hope that nothing would come between Nikki and Zack! 
 The authors really hit a home run with Zack. He took my breath away! Zack is one incredibly sweet, romantic and sexy guy. I loved Zack and Nikki together. I also love how this book dealt with some very adult subjects in a very sensitive way. This book contained just the right mix of sexy romance and emotion. Combined with the inventive story, it is great young adult book.

"I loved this story! First of all, although it's not required, I recommend reading the Emi Lost & Found series before beginning Contessa, only because there are certain events that occur in those books that will make Contessa and the Choisie series more understandable. In Contessa, we have the story of Olivia, who is the adopted daughter of a wealthy New York family. 
 I really love this book. The author does an incredible job of writing about the angst that teenagers experience. Don't shy away from the Young Adult/New Adult label, this is a richly written and emotionally full story with characters that feel incredibly real. The dialogue between the parents and the Olivia, and between Olivia and Jon, feel very authentic. 
 Without a doubt, Olivia is a little prickly and tough to love as a character. But she is very talented and seems to find love with Jon, despite the tough times and the rocky road she has with her parents. Contessa is also a beautiful story about first love.

"4 1/2 stars!! 
 I have read all of Chelle Bliss' books and I loved Resist Me. This is the fourth installment of the Men of Inked Series - each a standalone but all really great books, you do not need to read the previous books but I recommend that you do. Isabella ""Izzy"" Gallo is front and center in Resist Me, the youngest and only girl in a family of boys. She is hilarious! I literally laughed out loud while reading this book. Bossy, loud and assertive, she has no intention of being subservient to any man, that is, of course until she meets up again with James. 
 James is, to put it mildly, a sexy-as-hell, bossy, strong, uber-Alpha hero. Izzy and James shared a hot night of passion once before, which ended with Izzy bailing in the morning. James, a close friend of one of her brothers, literally comes to the rescue in Resist Me, and won't let up until he makes Izzy all his. 
 All of Chelle's books have a warm sense of family and friends and Resist Me is no different. The story was fast-paced, the characters very well written, and the sex scenes were SCORCHING hot!! I recommend Resist Me (and the whole Men of Inked series), you won't be disappointed. 
 ""You know you want me,"" I growled, my lips a breath away from hers. ""I wrecked you for any other man. I own your ass, Izzy. I'll let you run, but you can't resist me forever.""

"I am a huge fan of Chelle Bliss and I always devour her latest books. Uncover Me is the latest entry in the Gallo family series (they can be read as standalones but they're all so good - don't miss out!) and tells the story of Thomas, who has been working undercover to bust a criminal MC. The problem is that he and Roxy, a dancer, are together, and he knows it will break her heart when he has to bust the MC and go back to his ""real life."" 
 Could I go back home and be the Thomas Gallo I had been in my youth? The carefree ball buster amongst my family? Or had I been forever altered and perpetually changed by this mission? 
 Thomas has been undercover so long that he is staring to mix up his old life up with his new, fake identity. As with all of this author's books, this story is filled with warmth, love, family and plenty of steamy scenes between Thomas and his sweet Angel, who has led a very, very tough life. 
 Roxy had been doomed from the beginning; this had been her destiny before she'd been able to dream. Her mother was absent in her life, preferring to open her legs rather than care for her only child. For what she'd lived through, having been raised by babysitters and the men of the MC, Roxy had turned out relatively well. 
 Uncover Me has lots of action and it is almost a crime thriller because Thomas is an undercover DEA agent. All of the Gallos make an appearance here and I loved seeing them all again. Most of all, I loved the tension and the uncertainty between Thomas and Roxy and seeing how their relationship would play out. 
 What would she do without me? Roxy was my true north in this fucked-up life. 
 All in all, a great addition to the Gallo family series and the gorgeous brothers (and sister!) And don't miss Throttle Me if you haven't read it yet, it's a fantastic start to this series.

"4.5 stars!!! Too Much is a sexy, adult, EROTIC novel with some BDSM elements and lots and lots of thrilling, mind-blowing sex scenes! Lea Griffith is a new author for me and this lady can WRITE! Too Much jumps right into the action as Daly (love the name) boldly visits Jeremiah's BDSM club after leaving him 3 years earlier. She is delivering a cryptic message from his brother, the District Attorney for Atlanta, and is extremely cautious and a little fearful about seeing the very man that she walked away from years before. They both loved each other deeply and were both torn apart when she left. 
 Jeremiah is a HOT Dom who has only ever loved one sub, Daly. He is determined not to let her go again and Daly is pretty much powerless to resist him. This is not a typical D/s story in that the excellent writing and creative storyline elevates this above many books in this genre. The author does not skimp on the sexy times and Daly and Jeremiah's scenes together are SCORCHING HOT. Their blazing chemistry is actually built on real emotion and I truly felt a connection between these characters. Although some of the writing was a tad repetitive in the beginning, Jeremiah absolutely stole my heart: 
 ""Rules are naught between us. You have my everything because you will give me yours."" 
 There is a mystery in this story which brings back some of the old mistrust that caused Daly to leave Jeremiah before. I loved the supporting characters in Too Much (hello, Toby and Ruthie!) and also was intrigued by the lady cop, Savannah. I think she might be trouble and hope she gets her own story! 
 But the heart of this story is the absolutely blazing chemistry between Jeremiah and Daly. Although he is a Dom, he shows his tender and loving side with Daly and there a few ""vanilla"" scenes mixed in with the BDSM scenes. 
 ""Everything,"" She whispered when he raised his head. ""Always"", he affirmed. 
 All in all, I really loved this very adult, thrilling story and look forward to reading more from Lea Griffith.

"Each relationship was its own mess full of faults and flaws, fighting every damn day to be worthy. 
 What a perfectly dark ending to one of my favorite dark romance series! I read for escape and Monsters in the Dark offers just that. Pepper Winters has created a dark, sexy and highly erotic series with two unforgettable characters. Tess and Q are both damaged, flawed and perfectly matched for each other. I adore this series and read this intense story almost in one sitting. 
 Q was born into darkness, but he'd never baptized me in his blackest desires. And because of that, I could implicitly say he spoke the truth. No matter what he did to me, he would never truly harm me. 
 Told in dual POV's, this book is very, very dark and offers some BDSM along with the highly unusual relationship between Tess and Q. Having settled into married life, Q is hiding something from Tess that he fears will break them apart. But Tess is strong, brave and absolutely devoted to Q. She will let nothing and no one come between them! 
 We come alive when we're together with no cages or locks between us. 
 Q is fascinating and irresistible. I love him!! JE SUIS A TOI is a very graphic story but it is truly Pepper Winters at her best. I'm very sad to see this series end but looking forward to what is next from this author!

"4.5 stars!! Hot and sweet and funny. This was my first book by Cardeno C. and I absolutely loved it! 
 This story is told in the very clever way of Chase/Charlie looking back over time and telling his story through the format of looking through a photo album of his life. I adored this. The story itself is a beautifully-written mix of humor, pain, steam and sweetness. I can't wait to read more from this author. 
 Charlie/Chase has always been true to himself, which has not been easy for other men in his life. I loved his honesty! Although the book is told from three different POV's, it is really Charlie who is the main character in this story. Scott is his first love and their story is hot, sweet and heartbreaking. Scott moves away abruptly but remains the love of Charlie's life. Years later, Charlie meets Adan and thinks that maybe he could love again. The way these three eventually come together is both surprising and totally hot. The character development is fantastic and the writing, to me, almost flawless. I love reading how these three souls ultimately find a way to create a life that's right for them. 
 If you are in any kind of book slump, read this book.

"(Reviewed by Cathy for The Book Bellas) Our heroine takes a mental health get-away with her best friend. This was the start of her moving on and trying to let go of the past. She was getting all her ducks lined up so that she could have a clean break. 
 The first night she goes to a bar alone, feeling odd and out of place. She meets a hot guy who clearly wants her and only her. This is only supposed to be a one-week arrangement. But will she allow her past not to ruin her future? And is this guy too good to be true? 
 I really liked how this book began. It was different. However, I found some parts a bit predictable and knew the whole plot by the time the heroine met Derek at the bar. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot but the heroine had a huge issue with her ex, and when she meets Derek it did not affect her. That to me was not believable, BUT everyone should rad this book and judge for themselves. The sex was down-right HOT and Derek sounded delicious!!

"""If you kiss like that when you're not into it, I'd love to see how you kiss when you are."" 
 LOVE Nix!! I read a lot of biker books so I was totally surprised when I finished Incandescent and loved it! Kadence is a schoolteacher and never expects to fall for the oh-so-hot Nix who is the parent of one of her students. He is a bad-ass biker with a heart of gold, trying his best to parent his son Z with a no-good ex-wife who is always causing problems. 
 Kadence has dealt with a lot of past pain (both physical and emotional) and the last thing she expects is to fall for Nix. But the man is persistent and can't stay away from the sexy teacher. 
 ""I haven't been able to get you out of my mind, woman. Your attitude, your body, from the moment I had you on the back of my bike, I knew I was in trouble. You feel it too, Kadence. I know you do. Stop denyin' it."" 
 These two have tons of chemistry but there are some obstacles in their way. For one thing, Nix is the parent of Kadence's student, and the school has a no-dating policy between parents and teachers. Add to that one crazy ex-wife, and an even crazier (and more dangerous) ex of Kadence's and you have lots of fast-paced drama and totally HOT sexy times. This book takes dirty-talking to a new level, and River Savage has quite the talent at writing absolutely SIZZLING sex scenes! 
 This is a fast-paced, hot biker romance with a lot of heart. I loved Kadence and Nix and adored how Nix got Kadence to open up to him. 
 ""I want this man. Want everything he was doing to me, and then more."" 
 River Savage is an incredibly talented writer and I look forward to reading the next books in this series!

"4.5 stars!! 
 I absolutely LOVED Frenched so I was thrilled to be able to read more about Lucas and Mia when they returned from France (If you haven't read Frenched yet, it is a must-read!) Yanked takes place a few months later with Mia living back in Detroit and Lucas in New York City. This novella is still as funny, sexy and sweet as the first book, and even though Lucas brings some drama into their relationship, this is an incredibly steamy and satisfying continuation of their story. 
 The Frenched Series is highly addictive and very well-written. Melanie Harlow writes beautiful romance, and really knows how to bring on the hotness factor! Mia remains a funny and smart heroine in Yanked and Lucas is still one of my favorite book boyfriends. This is a fairly quick, hot read, and the series so far is one of my absolute favorites. Ms. Harlow is a breath of fresh air and in addition to the incredible sex scenes, the settings of her books are fantastic. I can't wait for more books from this author, and cannot wait to see where her stories go next!",0,4,1,191,47.82,34.1,47.68,99.0,19.1,15.71,83.77,71.73,52.36,8.38,5.76,2.62,0.0,0.52,1.05,1.57,2.62,15.18,6.28,2.09,12.04,7.33,8.38,9.95,1.57,15.18,11.52,5.76,2.09,1.57,0.52,0.0,6.28,0.0,6.28,1.05,0.52,1.57,1.57,1.57,2.62,0.0,8.38,8.38,0.0,2.62,2.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.9,4.19,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.52,1.57,5.24,0.0,0.52,2.09,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.09,0.0,0.0,2.09,0.0,0.0,3.14,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,1.05,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.76,9.95,0.0,2.09,7.33,0.52,0.0,0.52,4.71,2.62,7.85,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,14.66,4.19,4.71,0.0,2.62,1.05,2.09,0
"Incredibly dark but ultimately I really liked this book. 
 I am not easily shocked but this book made me very uncomfortable because it goes to some really dark places -- non-con, human trafficking, punishments -- but the writing is very good and I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story as I read. 
 What began as a disturbing story of a young woman being taken against her will, turned into a rather hopeful (dare I say?) story which left me wanting more of these characters. I read a lot of dark erotica, and I almost gave up on this book because at first I felt disoriented, like I had been suddenly thrust into a world that I knew nothing about. But I am so glad I kept reading, this is a vivid, explicit story that was engrossing from beginning to end. 
 Irrevocable kept me guessing until the very end. I loved the main characters of Silver and Kirk and I would love to read more about them. Silver is really kick-ass and is actually a very strong female character despite her rather dire circumstances. 
 If you are a fan of dark romance, then this book is for you. Don't read this if you are offended by non-consensual sex and torture. But Irrevocable is a challenging read, and for me, an enjoyable story by an author whose books I have never read before. I am a fan now and can't wait to dive into Skye's other stories.

"4.5 stars!! ""Come in. Sit anywhere but on the bed. Don't look cute, don't get undressed, and don't touch my underwear."" 
 I really loved the latest book in the Wild Seasons series! It is very, very funny, had really hot scenes and a wonderful storyline. Harlow is a funny, smart-ass, modern and smart heroine. Finn is another nuanced, sexy and loving leading man created by this fabulous writing duo. This is not a cliched contemporary romance story but instead has some very serious themes woven into the story. 
 Harlow and Finn have lots of miscommunications throughout the story but their scenes together are fantastic and their chemistry feels real and genuine and never forced. I truly thought that the authors could not top the first book in this series but Harlow and Finn are every bit as addictive as the characters from Sweet Filthy Boy. 
 These two are at opposite ends of the spectrum personality-wise but their banter and sexy times are hilarious and very, very hot. Don't miss this book. It is a wonderful, passionate and very funny read with lots and lots of heart. Can't wait for the next book in this series, Dark Wild Night, which will give us Lola and Oliver's story and is scheduled for release in 2015!

"Fifteen Weekends was a light, romantic and fun story, a true contemporary romance about a group of three friends, told from several different POV's. 
 This book also had some darker moments, especially marked by the near-constant thunder and impending storms in the background. It was great to read a book from a writer that I wasn't familiar with and I loved getting lost in the world of Ashleigh, Amanda and Emily. And their men!! They were each very different, but yet all had at least one trait or experience that most women could probably relate to.... Family dysfunction, work headaches, and the boyfriend who left who might have been the love of your life. 
 The author beings a fresh voice to contemporary romance. I had preconceived notions about each of these characters and the male characters as well but there turned out to be quite a few surprises in this story! The guys are all pretty swoon worthy and the storyline took lots of unexpected twists and turns. Ms. Pastore also has an incredible eye for detail and description which draws you right into the story. 
 All in all, Fifteen Weekends is a great bit of escapist reading, a wonderful contemporary romance story about a close group of friends and their trials and tribulations on the way to their own happy endings. I really liked the author's writing style and look forward to reading more from her in the future!",2,4,1,240,80.08,64.67,19.26,95.23,20.0,20.42,87.5,68.33,56.25,8.33,5.42,1.67,0.0,0.83,0.42,1.67,2.92,21.25,10.0,1.67,13.33,6.25,5.83,7.92,0.42,11.67,8.75,7.08,4.17,2.92,0.42,0.83,9.58,1.67,7.92,0.42,0.0,0.83,2.5,0.42,2.92,0.0,7.92,6.67,0.83,2.5,2.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.92,4.58,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.42,2.92,8.33,0.0,1.25,1.25,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.92,1.25,0.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.42,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,6.25,9.17,0.83,1.67,5.42,1.67,0.0,0.0,2.5,5.83,2.08,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.92,5.42,4.17,0.0,1.67,1.25,0.42,0
"Mia Lauren is introduced in Enthrall, Book 1 of the Enthrall Sessions series. She is working at the elite club Enthrall, and is thrust into a heady world of power and wealth and the captivating and magnetic Richard Booth and Cameron Cole, best friends who share everything with each other. Cameron targets Mia as a submissive for Richard in an effort to draw him away from his dark behaviors. 
 Many family secrets come to light, ones that are life-changing and highly damaging. Will Richard and Mia be able to overcome their pasts and love one another? Mia craves submission, but Richard becomes reluctant to engage in the lifestyle with her. 
 Cameron sees what must be done with Mia and she falls under his dominant spell. This book started off a little slow for me but definitely picked up once the author allowed Mia's relationship with both Richard and Cameron to blossom. The writing flows and the story of the characters is written beautifully. I loved Cameron's training of Mia, and this series is perfect if you are interested in layered and nuanced characters and a story that flows. Will Mia ultimately choose Richard, her love, or Cameron, under whose spell she has fallen? 
 This is a highly sensual story and not really meant to be read as a standalone. There is no real cliffhanger but the author definitely left me wanting much, much more of Mia, Richard and Cameron's story. The next installment should prove to be very enlightening and I can't wait to read where these characters are going. All in all, I highly recommended series for fans of a good, sensual, BDSM-themed story.

"OMG!!! Expect even MORE surprises and twists from E.K. Blair!!! Never in a million years did I see these developments coming. A tense thriller but with the deep, unbreakable love between Declan and Elizabeth at the center of the story. 
 ""I never gave up on life 
 because of him 
 I kept going 
 because of him"" 
 Hush is the last installment in the very dark story of characters that I will not soon forget. If you have waited until all the books are out in this series, well, wait no more! I highly recommend this highly imaginative and incredibly twisted series. All of the hype surrounding these books is very well-deserved, in my opinion. Nina/Elizabeth, Declan, Bennett, Pike...I grew to care deeply about each and every one. I will never forget this conclusion to this series. While I am saddended that this is the end of the series, I cannot wait to see what E.K. Blair dreams up next. 
 If you have read the first two books, you know that Elizabeth has lived through unimaginable suffering. BANG, the first book in this series, is one of my top favorite books ever. The emotions, the thrills and the incredible darkness in that book left me reeling. The characters have come full circle here, and although the author certainly stays true to the dark nature of the series, the ending was perfect for these characters. 
 ""We are monsters and lovers, animals and killers, but nothing can extinguish what we have when we're together."" 
 As I was coming to the ending of HUSH, I thought, ""Where is the author going with this? There are only a few more pages left! GAH!!"" E.K. Blair never takes the easy way out and she remained fiercely honest to each of her characters in this series. Sympathies will be challenged and emotions will be tested in HUSH. I am being vague because there is an incredibly risky and very surprising conclusion to this series and it must be experienced first-hand while reading, without knowing any spoilers. Don't skip to the end!! It has been days since I finished this book and these characters are still filling my head and my heart. Don't miss HUSH and don't miss the BLACK LOTUS Series. You won't soon forget these stories.

"OMG WHAT DID I JUST READ??! This review is totally spoiler-free so you will just have to go in to ECHO completely blind. That being said, this is without a doubt one of my top books so far this year. If you have read BANG, you know that things ended quite abruptly. Anything I say here about any of the characters that appeared in BANG might give the plot of ECHO away, so...if you like dark, twisty, psychosexual thrillers, than ECHO should be at the top of your must-read lists. And yes, I was up all night reading this one. 
 E.K. Blair is an enormously gifted writer and I will read anything this woman writes. I cannot describe what goes on in ECHO other than to say, ""READ THIS BOOK!!"" You will be thrilled, heartsick, turned on, and excited all at once. Your emotions will run rampant after reading this book. If you thought you knew the characters at all in BANG, trust me, you are wrong. 
 ""Did you know it was possible to have feelings with no emotions? You can, and I'm proof of it."" 
 Well, that's about all I can say, folks. I can't really describe what ECHO is, so please make sure you grab this one as soon as it is released on May 12th. You will be once again immersed in a dark and twisty world of E.K. Blair. And that's a great place to be.

"I really liked this book, it is funny, dirty, and is the kind of book that you can't look away from. The author's warning caught my attention, there is a TON of swearing in this book but it is also really funny and not at all what I expected. 
 This is not your typical high school drama, Bronagh and Dominic fight like cats and dogs which is kind of like their foreplay. She is also feisty, likable, curses all the time, and has some body issues. I loved her! The relationship between the two main characters is unpredictable and fresh. I also absolutely loved all the Slater Brothers and look forward to reading more about their exploits. 
 This book is written in Irish dialect which the author explains right out of the box. I enjoyed it but it might be a little much for some readers to digest. This book is also hilarious and contains more F words than I think any book I have ever read. Dominic has some very endearing characters and totally hot sex scenes. I guarantee this book is different from any book you have read so far this year! Give it a try if you love strong heroines and gorgeous, Alpha fighters. There is also a ton of action, making this a fast-paced, sexy and funny read. I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Casey!

"Add this to your summer reading list! Liam Wilder is my new obsession! Scoring Wilder is the perfect summer read - sexy, funny, swoon-y and fast-paced. I fell in love with Liam (and Kinsley a little bit) from the beginning, and Liam didn't let go of my heart for the entire book! This story is the perfect combination of a smart, strong, witty heroine, a sexy, good-hearted bad boy, and a yummy story that is head and shoulders above most books in the genre. 
 Even if you are not a fan of New Adult books, you will LOVE Scoring Wilder! Liam Wilder is a famous professional soccer player with a bad-boy reputation. Of course, much of it is due to the ever-present media and some undeserved bad press. Kinsley is a smart, driven, talented and FUNNY rising soccer star who immediately falls in lust with her new soccer coach. They are acutely aware that they are forbidden to be together, and Kinsley has some very, very funny moments when she is struggling to fight her growing attraction to her soccer coach. 
 Oh - and Kinsley's previous relationships ended VERY badly so she doesn't trust anyone, let alone a tattoo-covered, world-famous soccer star. But Liam turns out to be a total sweetheart, romantic, honest, open and giving. But will Kinsley come to her senses in time? 
 Scoring Wilder has plenty of steam, hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, plus a gorgeous soccer-playing hero. What's not to love? If you are looking for a perfect summer read, Scoring Wilder is for you!

"Thank you to Jane Harvey-Berrick for writing an incredible story that had me enthralled from beginning to end! At Your Beck & Call is a weighty, sexy, beautifully written story with incredibly captivating characters that really could have been two or maybe even three books. This is an adult story that broke my heart several times over but ultimately left me uplifted and satisfied. 
 For the most part, At Your Beck & Call is told from Hallen's POV as he describes his journey from a young college graduate through adulthood as he works as a male escort in L.A. The book spans several years, is incredibly rich and filled with memorable characters. But at its center is a love story which is absolutely fantastic! Yes, there is a much older woman involved but I absolutely loved the imaginative plot and all of the challenges and obstacles that Hallen faces as he fights to find (and hold) true love. 
 If you are looking for a deeply felt, gorgeous love story, then I highly recommend At Your Beck & Call. This is the first book I have read by Jane Harvey-Berrick and now I must read her other books! I fell in love with Hallen and I think you will, too.

"""From the day you first walked into my life, you've been saving me."" 
 Penelope Ward has written a richly detailed, VERRA sexy and emotional story with lots of new material and details. 
 This unputdownable story is told from Jake's point of view, who is one of my absolute favorite book boyfriends so I devoured every word of this cleverly-written book. It takes a very gifted writer to create a story that includes the most significant facts from another book (JAKE UNDONE) but which also includes incredibly fresh insights and beautiful, emotional, sexy and swoon-worthy new scenes. JAKE UNDERSTOOD can absolutely be read as a standalone, but it is also the perfect companion to Jake Undone. 
 This story is told mainly through a series of flashbacks, precipitated by a series of events that are driving a wedge between Nina and Jake's great love. I am a huge fan of male POV's and Penelope Ward once again nails the male voice. We get a sexy, gritty, emotional yet incredibly erotic and readable story that flows perfectly and will bring you to tears. 
 Marriage and family is not easy. And Jake and Nina have more uphill battles than most couples. Yet Jake is fighting hard for their love and for his girl. Do not shy away from this book out of the belief that it is merely a retelling of Jake Undone. It is much, much more!! Fall in love with Jake all over again in this gorgeous story. Another must-read from Penelope Ward!!

 Reviewed by Cathy: 
 Push is not our usual read, which by the way I loved. This is a f*d-up love story, to say the least. You might think you've heard that before, but honestly, you have never read a story like PUSH before. I won't go into detail about the plot because this book is best read without knowing too much about the storyline. Going in blind to this book is so much more thrilling! 
 Emma is moving on from her past and horrible stepfather and two brothers who were manipulated by him. She's had a rough life. She is starting over on her own, which is very freeing for her. She meets David they day she moves into her in apartment. He is the handyman for the building and was ""sent"" by the owner to fix her kitchen, which is a mess. She opens her door hesitantly, unsure of whether he's telling the truth or whether he is just a psycho. My anxiety attack began when she opened the door. You will need tranquilizers for this story!! It does end with a cliffhanger and I told myself, ""No! It can't end like this!"" But PUSH is so well-written that it is like a breath of fresh air. Get ready for a love-hate relationship with one of the characters. This is an excellent summer read! PUSH should be receiving more attention and acclaim because it's that good! Don't miss this one.",3,4,1,244,31.41,64.29,20.22,20.23,11.62,13.52,92.62,75.82,61.48,18.44,11.48,2.05,0.41,1.64,6.56,0.41,6.97,18.85,7.79,1.64,13.11,11.89,4.1,6.97,2.46,21.72,5.74,4.1,4.1,1.23,0.82,2.05,10.25,0.82,9.43,1.23,1.23,1.23,1.23,0.41,4.51,0.0,7.38,3.69,3.69,3.28,2.46,0.82,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.8,4.92,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.41,2.46,11.07,0.82,0.0,4.92,2.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.05,0.0,0.82,1.23,0.0,0.0,1.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.15,9.43,0.41,3.28,4.92,0.41,0.41,0.41,5.33,4.92,8.61,1.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.67,6.15,3.28,0.0,3.69,2.87,3.69,0

"4.5 Stars - very very addictive - really loved Naz, in all his dark and tortured glory. He is my favorite part of this story and is a very, very complex character. For all of his very, very bad equalities, and there are many, he really loves Karissa and will let nothing stand in the way of keeping her safe. This is a very twisty story that begins in Book #1 and is part intense love story and part suspense story. 
 Torture to Her Soul was a tiny bit slow for me midway through the story only because I have such high esteem for J.D. Darhower and her storytelling abilities. But the characters and the story are really fantastic and Mafia romances are one of my favorites genres. So I completely loved Naz, even when I hated him. 
 This entire story is solely from Naz's POV and is a fascinating look inside his very dark mind. I could not wait for this conclusion to the incredible story from Monster in His Eyes and it did not disappoint. A must-read for all fans of darker romance. 
 Favorite quote:

"Until Nico is the fourth book in a series but it can be read as a standalone (I have not yet read the first three books and I still thoroughly enjoyed Nico!!) All of the other characters play a role in the story but the author did a great job at making this purely Nico and Sophie's story. I absolutely LOVED the dirty-talking, possessive and sweet Nico! I was surprised at the quick way they met and fell for each other, as I am not usually a fan of Insta-love. But it worked perfectly here. 
 """"You know, the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one for me,"" I say gently, watching her eyes get big. ""You're mine, Sophie. Every beautiful inch of you is mine."" 
 Nico is the love-'em-and-leave-'em type. He is also very family-oriented, sexy as hell and willing to take his time (sort of) with the shy and closed-off Sophie. The sex scenes are AMAZING and off-the-charts steamy! 
 ""I know what I want. I always get what I want. And that's the last thought in my head before I fall asleep."" 
 Until Nico has really strong characters, a very sweet storyline and because Nico is a bounty hunter, there is of course lots of action thrown in. I really liked this story and am looking forward to reading the first three books in this series!",1,4,1,233,37.95,20.24,64.53,95.94,14.56,11.59,88.41,75.97,60.52,15.88,12.45,7.73,0.0,2.15,1.29,1.29,3.43,17.17,9.01,2.15,10.3,7.73,6.44,9.01,0.86,16.74,6.87,5.58,1.72,0.43,0.86,0.43,14.16,2.15,12.02,1.72,0.86,1.72,1.72,3.0,3.0,0.0,6.87,6.01,0.0,2.15,1.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43,9.44,3.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.72,6.01,0.43,0.0,0.43,0.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.43,0.0,2.15,0.0,0.43,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.86,0.86,0.0,0.0,0.86,1.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43,5.58,9.01,0.86,1.72,5.15,1.72,0.0,0.0,3.86,5.15,5.58,0.0,1.29,0.86,0.43,0.0,0.0,22.75,5.15,4.29,0.0,2.15,2.15,9.01,0
"""Someone special once told me to dare to dream. For without dreams, we have nothing to look forward to. I'm starting to believe her."" 
 The Resistance completely took me by surprise with its perfect writing, passionate and heartfelt characters, and absolutely fantastic sexy times!! This is the first book I have read by S.L. Scott and I can't wait to read her other novels. 
 I went into this blind and was drawn right into the fast-paced story of Holliday and Jack. Thank God for a smart, strong heroine! I am so tired of weak, cookie-cutter heroines and Holli was a breath of fresh air. She created her own business and the corporate side of this story was very realistic and not over-dramatized like many books have done lately. So thank you, Ms. Scott, for that. Holli doesn't need anyone, she's lonely but wrapped up in growing her business. So Jack Dalton is the last person she expects to fall for when she attends a convention in Las Vegas. 
 They have immediate chemistry but he is actually a very sensitive, lonely guy who also looking for a deeper connection than his usual parade of one-night stands. 
 Trust me, this book is so well-written that I lost myself in the words and read this in almost 1 day. I wish I would have read The Resistance slower! The storyline is also rich with other characters, and of course, lots and lots of hot sex. 
 I must feel that the main characters are emotionally connected to each other, and the author succeeds on all levels. I as a reader also must feel a connection to the characters and I really cared about Jack and Holli. Their dialogue is witty, they both grow emotionally during the story, and I can't say anything negative at all about The Resistance. I absolutely love a rock star story that explores the perils of fame and excess, and this book also does that perfectly. A must-read by an author to watch!",5,5,1,334,42.18,28.53,23.13,71.88,15.18,17.66,88.92,73.65,57.49,14.37,9.88,5.09,0.3,0.3,2.99,0.9,4.49,16.17,7.19,0.9,13.17,7.78,6.89,8.98,1.5,15.87,9.58,3.29,3.89,0.6,1.2,2.4,10.48,0.9,9.58,1.2,0.0,2.1,1.2,2.69,2.99,0.0,8.38,5.39,2.1,2.4,0.6,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.0,11.98,5.09,0.9,0.9,0.0,0.6,3.29,6.89,0.0,0.0,3.29,0.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.99,0.3,0.0,2.1,0.9,0.3,2.1,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.3,0.0,0.9,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.6,1.2,5.09,8.98,1.5,1.2,5.09,1.5,0.0,1.2,3.59,2.99,5.09,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,16.17,5.99,4.79,0.0,1.5,1.5,2.4,0
"3.5 stars! I thought On My Knees was going to be a classic contemporary romance but it is much more emotional, angsty and well, unusual, than I expected. Cameron and Maya were in love but break up and lose track of each for five long years. Maya works in a soul-crushing job in New York City, where she drinks and parties too much to try and mask the pain of losing Cameron. They run into each other by chance and this time around, he is determined not to let her go. 
 Their chemistry is incredible, and the story is very gripping. Ms. Wild is a very gifted writer and I loved how she created a not-so-perfect heroine in Maya. She tries to push Cameron away with her prickly personality but he can't let go this time. I was not a fan of the office drama that occurs involving Maya's co-workers and boss, but I still felt every ounce of drama and fear that Maya felt. On My Knees is a very memorable and very steamy story that will keep you turning the pages until the very end! And it seems as though we will be hearing more from these characters since next up is a book about Cam's brother and Maya's friend! All in all, a very enjoyable and sexy story with a well-written cast of supporting characters.",0,4,1,228,53.67,37.53,49.0,39.38,19.0,14.04,86.4,69.74,56.58,11.4,7.89,3.07,0.44,0.44,3.07,0.88,3.51,15.79,6.14,0.88,13.6,6.14,6.14,10.09,1.32,14.04,6.58,5.26,5.7,1.75,2.63,1.32,10.09,1.32,8.33,2.63,0.88,0.44,0.88,0.0,4.39,0.44,10.53,5.7,4.39,3.07,1.32,1.32,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.53,3.51,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.44,1.32,7.46,0.44,0.0,3.07,1.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.51,0.44,0.0,3.07,0.0,0.0,2.63,0.44,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.32,0.88,3.95,10.53,0.44,2.19,6.58,0.0,0.44,1.75,2.63,3.07,4.39,2.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.6,4.82,3.51,0.0,1.32,1.75,2.19,0
"5 amazing stars!! 
 JB Salsbury is my go-to author for hot, swoony but very loving and caring and all-around PEEFECT Alpha males. Each book in the Fighting series gets better and better and Cameron Kyle... well, Cameron Kyle broke my heart over and over again. Excerpt that he is the kind of character that expects no pity from anyone. The Prologue in this book is absolute perfection and I don't think I ever have felt so much sympathy for a character in a long, long time. 
 Cameron is my favorite of all of the characters in the Fighting series. His struggles hit very close to home for me and the author totally nailed his constant battles with memory loss. But make no mistake - Cam is one HOT Alpha male, and never lets anyone forget that. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Eve. She has overcome a painful past and her self-esteem issues were truly heartbreaking. Cam and Eve make an unlikely couple, but their attraction led to an undeniable, unstoppable, powerful, once-in-a-lifetime kind of love. This story is unputdownable (is that a word?) and is a must-read. You will have ""tummy flips"", heartbreak, tears and swoony moments that don't come along very often in NA, contemporary romance books. Bravo, JB Salsbury. Cameron stole my heart in this one.

"Alex Avery might be one of the sexiest book boyfriends around! Smart, hard-working, wealthy, possessive, yep, he is HOT. And the fact that he is honest and very protective of Angel only adds to his appeal! 
 In this second installment of the After Dark, we find Angel in danger arising from one of the sexual assault cases she is investigating. There is a thriller aspect to this book which adds something extra to the usual contemporary romance genre. There is plenty of steamy sexy times between Alex and Angel but I was a little frustrated at times by Angel's almost-constant fear of being in a relationship and her often-impulsive attempts to push Alex away. This created lots of drama for me and I honestly thought the author would leave us with a cliffhanger but this story has a very satisfying conclusion. 
 There are lots of twists and turns in this story and LOTS of HOT scenes between Alex and Angel, and actually some incredibly tender moments, too. I absolutely loved the radio talk-show scenes and would love to read more about that side of Angel in the future. There did not seem to be as much emphasis on the radio show in this book and I love those call-in therapy sessions with Dr. Hemming. There was no cliffhanger here but there is definitely room for more stories about Alex and Angel and I can't wait to see where Ms. Aymes takes this hot couple!

"4.5 - 5 UNFORGETTABLE STARS!! 
 If the mark of a good book is that you can't stop thinking about it, then CORRUPT is a winner. I love dark books but even I was close to not finishing this one due to the darkness and rage that filled the early part of the book. But what a story!!! Dark, sexy, thrilling, action-packed...and filled with twists and turns that took this cynical dark romance reader by surprise. 
 Let me be clear that if Penelope Douglas wrote a grocery list, I would read it. BULLY is one of my favorite books and her new contemporary romance MISCOUNDUCT is one of the best books I've read this year. So there's my disclaimer! 
 If you are looking for a gripping, edge-of-your-seat book, then CORRUPT is for you. It is rough, it is scary, it is sexy...but it is ultimately incredibly thrilling and emotionally satisfying. And the sex scene near the end of the book? Holy moly. Kudos to you, Ms. Douglas, you thrilled even this jaded erotica reader. 
 AS I was reading, I couldn't help but fear for Rika and the dire circumstances she found herself in. But she's an unusual female protagonist in that she literally could give as good as she got, and she never, ever once cowered or allowed herself to be overpowered by the ""Four Horsemen."" I still think about all of these characters weeks after finishing this book. And that to me is what makes a good book great. 
 CORRUPT is not your average dark romance. It is really a stand-out book. Highly, highly recommended.

"4.5 stars!!! 
 What an addictive and enjoyable story! Nicola Haken is a new author for me and I will definitely read more of her books. Being Sawyer Knight is not only an incredibly hot and sexy story, it is also filled with plenty of tender and emotional moments and a beautiful message about learning to love and accept yourself. 
 Sawyer Knight is a world-famous musician who longs for people to see the real him and not just his rock-star stage persona. He has very little to do with his mother, and had an abusive stepfather who was only interested in Sawyer's fame as a musician. He hasn't spoken to his best friend Jake since they were teenagers, when Sawyer could not deal with Jake making his true feelings known for Sawyer. 
 Jake has followed Sawyer's career and is the only person who has ever really known the real Sawyer. He comes back into Sawyer's life as his bodyguard and is still very much in love with Sawyer. Now he just has to convince Sawyer that they belong together. The chemistry between these two is literally explosive and burns up the pages! I absolutely fell in love with Jake and his bossy, dominating ways. He cannot stay away from Sawyer, but will Sawyer admit his true feelings for Jake? 
 This book is told in dual POV's which I thought worked great. There is a side plot involving death threats to the band but to me, it is the scorching hot sex scenes between Jake and Sawyer that made this book come alive. Nicola Haken is an incredibly talented writer and I devoured this book almost in one sitting. There is also a beautiful love story at the heart of this book and I was sad to see Jake and Sawyer's story end! I can't wait to read Ryder's story, which is coming up next.

"""A series of struggles strung together with the occasional moment of joy that makes it worth going another day."" 
 This quote from Eric sets the tone for this emotional, angsty book that tells Eric and Sarah's story. Eric is the drummer for Damaged, Tucker's bandmate. He tries to drown his emotional sorrows in lots of liquor and lots of women. 
 ""The deeper your love, the harder you fall when it goes bad."" 
 I loved Cass and Tucker from the first installment in the White Trash Trilogy and was looking forward to reading more about Eric's story. He is a very loyal and protective character who experienced a terrible loss. He loves Sarah, but despite their attraction and genuine affection for each other, she chooses her boyfriend Derek over Eric. Adding to the drama is the fact that Derek and Eric are bandmates. 
 The author does not make her characters' paths to happiness an easy one. Sarah and Eric must both confront some some terrible issues from their pasts before they can find their happily ever after. I loved reading about Cass and Tucker, who are two very memorable characters from the first book in this trilogy. 
 Although I was a little annoyed at Sarah's behaviour in A Song for Us, I ultimately understood why she acted the way she did. There is just the right amount of steam and drama in A Song for Us. Although the story is a great conclusion to the White Trash Trilogy, I wouldn't mind reading more about the rest of the band members!

"(Reviewed by Cathy for The Book Bellas) I was really surprised how much I liked this book. From the start, I was having palpitations. You know when you're reading and you're waiting for a disaster to happen? That was me. I empathized with the main character right from the Prologue. This is my kind of book - Louis is 30, wealthy, hot, a womanizer with a really foul mouth. What more can you ask for? Emily is 18 years old and meets Louis while filling in as a waitress for her sister's catering job. She can't keep her eyes off this magnetic man, who has every women salivating for him. She notices that his eyes are following her the entire time. But he just leaves that night without saying a word to her. Her obsession starts from that day. All she does is fantasze about him. Louis hired her sister's company for more parties. She find out it's him and signs up to work the jobs. Louis approaches her and lets her know how he can't stop thinking about her, and how much he wants her. They go out for coffee and dinner but he is so cocky that she sets him straight, and from there on he switches because he realizes just because she's young, she's not a push over. Their obsession for each grows, they can't be without each other. They are consumed with one another. She lives for only him. He changes his lifestyle for her, stops sleeping around and breaks up the the ""boys"", his best friends. 
 Will his past interfere, and her insecurities doom them? 
 The sex scenes were great. I was so hot the entire read! The ending felt a little forced but all in all Love in Rewind is really worth reading. I have recommended it to all my friends! I give it a 4 - 4.5 stars.",1,4,1,313,23.99,92.39,3.77,38.76,11.59,14.38,91.37,75.4,61.98,22.36,18.21,3.19,0.32,1.28,11.5,1.6,4.15,19.17,6.07,1.6,12.78,9.27,5.75,6.07,1.28,17.89,6.07,5.11,3.51,2.24,0.64,0.64,13.42,1.6,11.18,4.15,2.24,1.6,0.0,0.96,3.83,0.0,3.83,2.24,0.96,1.28,0.32,0.32,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.41,3.19,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.96,17.89,0.64,0.64,7.67,5.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.15,0.32,0.0,3.19,0.64,0.0,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.64,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,6.07,8.31,1.28,0.96,4.47,0.64,0.0,0.96,4.79,2.88,8.95,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.89,7.35,3.83,0.96,0.64,3.19,1.92,0
"4.5 stars!! Emma Chase has written another totally hot, hilarious and very warm story that will have you laughing out loud and turning the pages until the end. A funny and very sexy book, Tamed tells Matthew and Dee's story from Matthew's POV. No one writes a male POV quite like Emma Chase! I loved getting inside Matt's head and I loved watching his feelings for Dee unfold. 
 Emma Chase's pop culture and movie references are an absolute favorite of mine, her references are modern, witty and hilarious. The scenes between these two characters are outrageously HAWT and exhilarating. My boyfriend Drew makes an appearance in Tamed along with Kate and Billy, but center stage is Matt and the wild Dee. This is the perfect summer read, it is fast-paced, incredibly sexy, and laugh-out-loud funny. Enjoy the latest installment in the Tangled series, you will not be able to put it down!

"One word: glorious! 
 Thank the gods for Mia Sheridan! Becoming Calder is so very beautiful, my heart was overflowing in some parts, and breaking in others. This story is completely original and the characters are so brave and honest, that I was lost in this book from beginning to end. 
 Calder and Eden's story is very unconventional and is very painful in parts. But their bond is so strong and passionate, that I just knew that they would be able to withstand any heartache and pain that came their way. I feel very strongly about the type of ""community"" that Eden and Calder lived in, and many scenes were almost too painful to read. I feel that the author absolutely nailed the psychological and physical abuse so accurately that it blew me away. This story unfolds layer by layer, with the reader joining in Calder's slowly dawning realization that he and his family did NOT, in fact, live in a paradise. 
 ""We hadn't chosen this life. It had chosen us."" 
 Calder and Eden's love is almost magical. But there is plenty of off-the-charts heat and longing between them to satisfy every contemporary romance reader. The story has tons of twists and turns and there are so many obstacles thrown at Calder and Eden that I was afraid they wouldn't survive. 
 ""Where do you find your strength, Morning Glory, he had asked me. 
 From you, I had said, smiling and pulling him close."" 
 Try to read this book without reading too many reviews with spoilers. Becoming Calder is passionate, refreshingly original and completely satisfying. A must-read!!

"5++ stars!! Stayed up all night reading!! Many thanks to the author for the ARC because once I started reading, I absolutely could not put it down. Karissa is a poor college student, struggling in particular with a Philosophy class. The professor is a jerk and if she gets a low grade in the class, she will lose her scholarship. 
 Naz and Clarissa meet by chance outside the classroom when he stops to pay a visit to her professor. He is the quintessential bad boy, but a wealthy one, and slowly begins to sweep Karissa off her feet. She leads a very quiet and simple life, and finds herself falling hard for the incredibly sexy and overwhelming Naz. This is NOT the standard innocent-girl-meets-older-rich-guy trope, instead there are INCREDIBLE twists and some scorching hot sex!! 
 Naz is a bad boy but he really does treat Karissa like a princess. There is an undercurrent of uneasiness and dread during this book but it is not until the last part of the book that the incredibly shocking plot twists are revealed.

"3.5 - 4 stars!! 
 This book was a highly-anticpated read for me. It received lots of buzz early on and it is a solid first effort by Ms. Michaels. The story follows Catherine, a PR executive who lands a big account headed up by the sexy and gorgeous ex-SEAL, Jackson. She has a very painful past and there is lots of drama early on in the book between Catherine, her fiancee Neil, and a PR consultant named Piper. Beloved is very fast-paced story and has loads of sizzling sex scenes which were the highlight of the story for me. 
 Jackson is a strong, sexy and memorable hero and I loved how he took control with Catherine but also showed her his fun side, too. The story has lots of angst and does end with a cliffhanger, so I am definitely looking forward to seeing where this story goes. 
 There were a few minor details that stood out which affected my enjoyment of this otherwise very steamy and well-paced story. First, Catherine's lawyer friend commits a professional no-no early on in the book. Minor but crucial detail. I also find the new trend of naming fictional characters or companies (here, a law firm) after real-life people to be mildly annoying. It really does not add anything to the plot and is somewhat distracting. There were also some editing errors which were not corrected in the final version. These details would probably not be noticed by most, and I believe this author has lots of talent and look forward to reading more of her books. 
 All in all, Beloved this is a hot, fast-paced book with a good story, very memorable characters and some SCORCHING hot sex scenes!",1,4,1,285,58.62,21.77,29.09,74.93,17.81,20.0,86.67,69.47,55.09,9.82,4.91,2.46,0.0,0.0,2.11,0.0,4.91,16.84,8.07,1.4,11.23,7.37,7.02,7.72,1.05,13.68,9.82,6.67,3.16,1.05,0.35,1.75,11.23,0.7,9.82,1.4,1.05,0.35,1.75,0.7,3.86,0.7,5.61,4.56,1.05,2.46,1.4,1.05,0.35,0.35,0.0,0.0,7.02,3.86,0.0,0.35,0.35,0.35,2.46,3.86,0.35,0.35,2.11,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.91,0.35,0.0,4.56,0.35,0.0,1.75,0.35,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,3.16,10.53,1.05,0.7,6.32,1.4,0.35,1.05,2.81,4.91,5.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.09,5.61,4.56,0.0,1.05,0.35,3.51,0
"REVIEW: ALLURING TEMPTATION (BAYOU STIX #3) BY SKYE TURNER 
 JUNE 1, 2014 LEAVE A COMMENT (EDIT) 
 Alluring Temptation-2 
 Synopsis: 
 Liam Christianson is the devil-may-care, rhythm guitarist for Bayou Stix, the hottest rock band around. He's a playboy and likes to do things his way. No regrets. He knows that women love him, and he uses that to his advantage. He's cocky and shallow. Or so it seems. 
 Clove Rodrigue is the baby sister of Liam's bandmate and friend. She's a sweet, fairly innocent young woman who was dealt a bad hand and became a victim of circumstance. After finishing culinary school, she returns home to Baton Rouge. She finds herself living under the same roof as Liam and they quickly realize they are like oil and water. He hates how perfect she is, and she can't stand his treatment of women. 
 Both Liam and Clove are accustomed to letting others see only what they want them to see, each hiding behind false pretenses. 
 What happens when polar opposites realize that their hatred of one another is really attraction? Will they succumb to the allure? What happens when the things that you fight so hard against are the very things you need the most in the world?

 Ellen's Review 
 image 
 Skye Turner is one of those authors that has been on my TBR list forever. I have to confess that this wonderful author contacted me when her first book in the Bayou Stix series was released, and unfortunately for me, I was unable to get to read it at that time. I am so glad I got to read Alluring Temptation because I absolutely love her joyous, infectious and exuberant style of writing! With a heavy dose of Southern conversation, y'all. 
 Liam is your typical bad-boy rocker, but we get to really see inside his head with the dual POV's. In between all the meaningless sex with models and groupies, Liam is actually a very funny, smart guy who harbors deep feelings for Clove (love the name!), the little sister of Dade. The story is fast-paced, and I loved all of the Louisiana references, having lived in that state for several years during my younger days. All of the food and location references left me feeling very nostalgic for that beautiful state. 
 Clove is fighting to be recognized as a woman instead of the young, fresh-faced innocent girl that everyone sees her as. She is very sexy, but has a natural beauty and a sweet personality. She has had a crush on Liam forever but the sparks really fly when they both recognize that they have feelings for each other. 
 Skye has a unique writing style that is highly entertaining, real and very funny. The sex is smokin' hot and I loved getting into the world of Bayou Stix. This is Book #3 in a series, and I think it can be read as a standalone but the first two books do provide background on all the main characters. I really enjoyed reading Alluring Temptation and recommend it for anyone who wants a fairly quick, sexy and funny book about rockers and the women they love!

"WOW! If the rest of the Bend Anthology is this smoking hot and unexpected, then it will become one of my favorite reads of 2014. UnRaveled is darkly delicious, sensual, highly erotic and very, very sexy. This is not your usual erotica story, it is has some absolutely yummy twists and turns that satisfied even this most jaded of dark erotica readers.

"4.5 stars!! 
 Tristan and Lily are back in this haunting, gritty and very sexy installment in the Access Series trilogy. Although technically a standalone novel, I highly recommend the first two books in the series, Access All Areas and Access Unrestricted, which introduce the brilliant but troubled rock star Tristan Hunter and rock journalist Lily Taylor. This series offers an incredibly detailed and nuanced look behind the scenes of the music business told from the viewpoint of Lily. 
 In this book, Lily has agreed to go on tour with the world-famous Tristan and his band. Life on the road is a grueling and exhausting succession of endless hotel rooms, demanding fans and constant pressure from the record label. Tristan is a perfectionist and Lily soon learns that his ultimate focus is on the his music and the numerous details of performing live night after night. 
 ""As I watched him move, watched him shut the door, and heard the sound of the shower starting, I realized that he never stopped working. That even now he would be thinking of the sound check, and what to ask for, what to tell the band, remembering to get someone to fetch the girl from the front of the stage."" 
 ""Not for the first time, it struck me how lightly he carried enormous responsibility that he placed upon himself, to get it all right."" 
 Tristan and Lily had a sometimes-volatile relationship in the earlier books and Tristan constantly battled some serious addictions. He is more focused in this book but still exhibits some of the same insecurities and desperate need for love that makes him one of my favorite characters. Lily must deal with Tristan's deep connection with his lifelong friend and bandmate AC, who is battling his own demons. 
 Access Unlimited provides a harsh look into the perils of stardom and fame and also is an incredibly written description of life on the road. I absolutely loved the relationship between Tristan, AC and Lily and could not get enough of these three together! Alice Severin is a gifted and talented writer and these characters stayed with me long after I finished this book. I really hated to say goodbye to Tristan, Lily and AC and would love to read more about them in the future!",3,5,1,381,79.33,44.72,13.62,23.55,22.41,22.31,83.2,66.14,51.97,11.29,6.56,2.36,0.0,0.0,3.67,0.26,4.72,17.06,9.19,1.57,13.12,3.94,3.94,8.14,0.79,12.6,6.3,4.72,2.89,0.79,1.05,1.31,8.4,0.79,7.61,1.31,0.79,1.57,0.26,1.05,1.84,0.26,5.51,2.89,2.62,2.1,0.79,1.31,0.52,0.26,0.0,0.0,10.5,3.94,0.0,0.26,0.52,0.0,1.57,5.77,0.0,0.0,0.26,3.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.72,0.79,0.52,3.15,0.26,0.26,0.79,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.26,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.0,6.04,10.76,1.84,0.79,6.82,1.05,1.31,0.26,4.2,4.46,3.41,0.52,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.0,11.29,3.94,4.46,0.0,1.05,0.26,1.57,0
"Emma Chase is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I absolutely loved getting a Drew POV. Ms. Chase is a master (mistress?) at writing a sexy, sarcastic and funny male POV, and Tied does not disappoint! Drew is funny, smart, honest and totally lovable. 
 Drew and Kate and their friends all take a trip to Las Vegas before their wedding. And of course there's a million ways that this trip could go south. One of my favorite things about this series is how the characters speak directly to the reader, and Tied delivers all of the things I adore about this series plus more. It's funny, poignant and sexy, all in one. And there are some really beautiful sentiments about marriage and commitment, too. Awwww! 
 This is a light, easy, totally fun read, and is a delicious end to a beloved series. I am going to miss Drew and Kate!!

"I was fortunate to have read an early copy of this book and it absolutely blew me away. Remember CONQUERED is not a standalone, and must be read after BESIEGED. It is an absolutely fantastic continuation of Theo and Lilly's story, filled with unexpected twists and turns and lots of heart-stopping emotion. Do not miss this one! 
 First, let me say that I love the cover which I find to be incredibly sexy. I imagine this is Lilly Parker. The characters of Lilly and Theo first got under my skin when I read Besieged and I felt every roller coater of emotion with these two throughout Conquered. Lilly can be extremely frustrating at times, but she is one tough cookie and really sticks to her guns no matter what happens. There were certain moments where I thought she was almost being too stubborn, but that is part of her appeal and also part of the drama and angst of this story. 
 The author write a fantastic and gritty male POV, which I love. My heart broke for Theo during this book as it is so obvious that Lilly is his one true love, but will he really do whatever it takes to get her to realize this? She lives so much in her head that even her friends have a tough time getting her to listen to reason. But there are so many twists in this story, and Lilly is faced with so much, that it is understandable why she acts the way she does. 
 Once once again I loved the cast of supporting characters and found them all to be quite endearing and very funny and protective of Theo and Lilly. And Theo...what a man! Total yumminess. My review does not do this book justice. Conquered is filled with scorching hot sex scenes, real dialogue, imperfect characters and pure emotion. It does NOT conclude Lilly and Theo's story and there is another book in this trilogy. I can't wait for Book 3! I need more Theo NOW!

"I love MJ Nightingale's writing style and this book delivers in sexy, swoony style. There is so much hot, steamy sex in this book that I had to look something up! But like Fire in Her Eyes, the main characters have a lot of heart, there is no game-playing, they fall hard and they work to make things right. This book is a standalone book, although characters from Fire In His Eyes make an appearance here. 
 Ana has a very painful past (I have not seen a character in her situation before!), loves sex and meets a gorgeous bartender for what she thinks will be a HOT one-night-stand. Teddy has some FABULOUS attributes (hint, hint) and rocks Ana's world. Despite her best efforts to keep him at arm's length, he finds himself falling for this red-headed firecracker. 
 I love this author's books because they are about normal folks, with normal, satisfying jobs and who enjoy the simple things in life. I also love the Florida beach-town setting and the Florida locations in the spotlight. 
 Did I mention the sex scenes are absolutely off-the-charts? You will definitely need a cold shower after reading Afraid to Love! Teddy is a fantastic book boyfriend, too. I am keeping this review clean because this book surprised me with its sexy times. I think this author has lots of room for growth in future books - I bought a copy of Afraid to Love to check whether some of the small editing issues had been addressed; they are minor but this author deserves a perfectly-put-together book because her stories are definitely worth reading! I highly recommend this book for a hot, sexy book about two people who may not be looking for love but definitely find their HEA.",1,4,1,292,51.41,38.07,16.13,95.18,19.47,18.84,86.3,65.75,52.4,14.73,9.59,3.77,0.0,0.34,3.08,1.71,5.14,15.07,6.51,0.34,11.64,7.88,4.45,6.16,1.03,14.04,8.22,3.77,1.37,0.34,1.03,0.0,10.27,0.34,9.93,1.71,2.05,0.68,0.34,1.37,2.74,0.0,8.22,6.85,1.03,4.11,2.74,1.03,0.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.3,4.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,1.03,6.85,0.34,0.34,1.71,1.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.88,0.68,0.68,5.82,0.68,0.0,3.42,0.34,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.05,0.0,0.0,1.03,0.0,0.68,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.34,2.05,7.88,11.99,2.4,0.68,5.82,3.08,0.0,2.05,1.71,2.74,5.48,1.37,0.34,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0,16.44,3.77,4.45,0.34,1.37,1.37,5.14,0

"4.5 stars! 
 There is a fantastic new author on the scene and her name is April Emerson! Her debut novel absolutely blew me away with its nuanced writing and very original voice. 
 THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED tells the story of two very different people, shy, quiet, devout Emma, and sexy, compulsive, womanizer Eric. But the story quickly blooms into an intensely erotic and sensual story about two people really saving each other. Emma is an observant Catholic who teaches parochial school, has a few close friends but is very lonely and wounded. She is immediately and intensely attracted to bad-boy Eric, who has a very dangerous, deeply-rooted addiction (this is reveled early on in the story.) 
 ""Father, why would God bring this man into my life if He didn't want me to feel this?"" 
 What happens when two very different people with very dark secrets come together? The themes of good and evil are explored here by way of some scorching hot and erotic scenes. The way in which Eric's compulsions and addictions are dealt with make this a very different and unique story. Ms. Emerson writes in a third-person POV which works perfectly for this incredibly creative story. 
 Eric and Emma's imperfections allowed them to find something perfect, the bad cleared a path for the good, and every single moment was worth it. 
 The scenes between Eric and Emma are incredibly sensual and very erotic. The rural setting is perfect for this story and there is also some very nerve-wracking suspense as well. This is a fabulous, very adult, very erotic romance, that had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I absolutely love Ms. Emerson's writing style and I can't wait to read more from her. Definitely a writer to watch!",6,4,1,298,48.32,32.51,25.14,56.93,16.56,19.46,86.58,68.46,54.7,9.73,5.03,2.35,0.0,0.0,1.68,0.34,4.7,16.44,8.05,1.68,10.07,6.38,10.4,8.05,0.67,12.42,8.72,3.02,2.68,1.34,1.01,0.34,10.74,0.34,10.4,1.01,1.01,1.01,0.67,3.02,4.03,0.0,6.38,4.36,2.01,2.68,1.68,1.01,0.34,0.0,0.34,0.0,12.42,7.05,0.0,0.67,0.0,1.01,3.69,5.7,0.34,0.34,2.01,1.01,0.34,0.0,0.34,0.0,3.02,0.34,0.0,1.68,0.34,0.67,3.36,1.01,0.34,0.0,0.67,0.0,2.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.67,6.38,8.39,0.67,1.01,5.37,0.67,0.34,0.67,3.36,2.35,7.05,0.0,1.01,0.34,0.67,0.0,0.0,16.44,5.37,5.03,0.67,1.01,1.68,2.68,0
"6 STARS!!!! 
 This book HOOKED me from the first page until the very end. The author has given me another great love with M, and the story to me was every bit as gripping and gut-wrenching as Jesse and Ava's story. I was SO excited to read an early copy of this book!! One Night: Promised is a 6-star read for me and it is NOT to be missed. 
 Livy is a very relatable woman, a bit of an underachiever but working hard to put her past dysfunctional family life behind her. She leads a rather quiet and sad life. At first, she resists the mysterious stranger who visits her coffee shop, but M is nothing if not persistent and she finds herself accepting his very risky proposition - spend just one glorious night together. 
 ""I know a bad thing when I see it, and standing behind me is a man who could crush my logic."" 
 M is HOT and if you think this is a standard romance story, you are WRONG. M is nuanced, damaged, and yes, ultimately very lovable and Livy falls hard. This book has a TON of twists and heart-stopping turns so this review will be spoiler-free. The story is filled with fantastic, memorable characters including a wonderful supporting cast of friends and the amazing, funny and incorrigible Nan, Livy's grandmother. 
 Livy has blocked off her emotions for a very long time but she cannot resist M's no-strings-attached proposition. He makes her feel alive, BUT she does push back at certain points in the story which I found to be very believable and true to her character. M has many, many faults, and he turns out to be a very flawed, very human character. I fell in love with him immediately. 
 ""I've always tried to keep my life simple, but now I'm craving a complication - a tall, dark-haired, mysterious complication."" 
 I absolutely LOVED the gentlemanly, ""formal"" side of M. It fit in perfectly with his personality. This book has a slow build to it but you will be generously rewarded by sticking to the story. The author 
 thrilled me to my very soul by the end of the book. M to me is a actually a very loving person, wrapped up in a stunningly handsome, rather cold exterior. He makes makes a real effort to be close to Livy, to treasure her and care for her in his own way. 
 ""Beautiful things should be savored, Livy, not rushed."" 
 Overall, One Night: Promised is one of my top reads of the year so far. I absolutely cannot wait for November!! 
 ""Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours forever. Every kiss. Every touch. Every word.""

"I am crazy in love with Jodi Ellen Malpas and her books are absolute must-reads for me. 
 One Night Unveiled picks up immediately after the second book. The third book in the trilogy continues the slightly obsessive, crazy ride that started in the first two books. I am absolutely in love with Miller Hart and JEM has created another unforgettable, sexy, damaged hero that I will not soon forget. 
 This book is LOADED with sex, and the story at times veered off in several different directions. But at its core is the powerful love story between Livy and Miller that is all-consuming, fiery and possessive. Miller wasn't prepared to fall for Livy, but he did, and he will do absolutely anything to protect her and their new, fragile love. 
 ""You threw my perfect world into total chaos."" 
 I swear I swooned every time Miller opened his mouth! He worships Livy, and lets her see parts of him that he never revealed to anyone. For me, the second part of the story really solidified their relationship and I thought the ending was SUPERB. This series as a whole is unforgettable, and Miller Hart is without a doubt one of my new book boyfriends. JEM is a masterful storyteller and I was devastated to see this series end! 
 Favorite quote: 
 ""I'll love you until there's no breath left in my lungs, Olivia Taylor."" He locates my hand and brings my diamond to his lips. ""For eternity."" I shake my head mildly. ""It's not long enough."" ""Then beyond that, too,"" he whispers.

"Joint review for this one. Cathy: 
 5 stars!! 
 Jodi Ellen Malpas is a genius at making you feel sorry for her Alpha male even though he is so f*****d up, and knowing the heroine should RUN not walk the other way! I wanted Livy to stay and fight for Miller. And the author's phrasing is absolutely epic. I fell in love with the characters all over again in this book and wanted more. 
 I adored One Night Denied. I felt that Ms. Malpas really tapped into Miller's emotions and even though I believe that we really don't know his whole story yet, I was okay with the parts of his past that the author revealed. I loved this book even more than the first one and I cannot wait for the third book. 
 Ellen: 
 4.5 stars!! 
 I absolutely fell in love with Miller Hart all over again. This book begins right after Book 1 so there will be no spoilers here. The passion and the intensity that Miller feels for Livy were the best parts of the book for me. My heart broke for him in this book, and I was praying that Livy would get beyond her own painful past and let Miller love her. This is a man truly and deeply in love and he would let nothing and no one stand in his way. That is one of the many things that I love about the author's tortured heroes. 
 ""I'm madly fascinated by you, Olivia Taylor. You fill my dark world with light and my hollow heart with feelings. I've persistently informed you that I'll never go down easily."" 
 While I was not as obsessed with this book as I was with One Night: Promised, I absolutely loved it and I am very impatiently waiting for the next installment in Miller and Livy's story. Jodi Ellen Malpas remains one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I treasure every word she writes.

"4.5 stars!! 
 THE FACE IN THE MIRROR is a beautifully-written story about second-chance love. Renie and Mitchell had been in love when they were younger and circumstances conspired to drive them apart. They meet up again as adults and thankfully, Mitchell had not given up on them. I loved the way the author told both of their stories in dual POV's, which worked well in this book. 
 I loved Mitchell, he was patient, strong and kind. There is no graphic sex in this book, but the author really makes you fell the strong love between these two, the kind of love that really withstands the tests of time and outside influences. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but thankfully, Mitchell is patient with Renie and refuses to let go of his one true love. This story spans a lot of time and I loved how Renie really grew emotionally throughout the course of the story. She, too, cannot forget her first love and the incredibly strong bonds they shared. 
 ""I was lost. I was nothing, no one without you. I am Renie, a woman who is in love and hopeful that your future has a place for me."" 
 The Face in the Mirror is also a sometimes-painful exploration of family relationships, family secrets and coming to terms with the sometimes-poisonous figures in your life. The author skillfully explores the incredible story of a mother and daughter's relationship, told through the discovery of Renie's mother's journal. I absolutely loved reading those parts of the book and that part of the story is as strong as Renie and Mitchell's journey together. 
 If you are looking for an emotionally-staisfying, beautifully written book about love and family, then you will love The Face in the Mirror.

"I love Chelle's books because the characters are real-life people, not billionaire businessmen or weak heroines, but strong people with regular jobs and pretty normal problems. Well, except that Michael Gallo happens to be a hot, MMA fighter who also happens to work in his family business. 
 Mia is a hard-working physician with a heart of gold who hasn't had time to date or to find love. Michael literally sweeps her off her feet with lots of tender, romantic gestures, and because this is a Chelle Bliss book, tons and tons of SCORCHING hot sex! Michael is an Alpha and he knows what he wants. I love that Chelle's heroes are all pretty open and honest about what they want, right from the beginning. Michael doesn't play games and he opens his heart to Mia almost from the beginning. 
 I love the Gallo family and absolutely loved City from the first book in the Men of Inked series. And Michael is another sexy, manly Alpha who won't give up even when Mia tries to push him away. There is some drama that threatens to keep Michael and Mia apart but everyone gets their HEA in Hook Me, and I absolutely loved the Epilogue. The Gallo family is large and loving and I can't wait to read more of their stories!

"If you love a hard-working, sexy but sweet cowboy and a feisty heroine, you will love Rising Assets! This was my first book by Rebecca Zanetti and I loved it! Although Rising Assets is part of a series, you can definitely read it as a standalone. 
 Colt and Melanie have been close friends since they were very young. Life has not been easy for Mel but she is too proud to turn to Colt for any help. No need - Colt steps right in when he sees Mel struggling to work three jobs. He has a great plan for a new business venture but along they way, the friends start to see each other in a different way. And who can resist a sexy Alpha cowboy who's smart and driven at business?? 
 ""If you're not smart enough to take care of yourself, you damn well do take orders from me."" 
 He stepped into her space. ""If I had really spanked you, darlin', you'd know it."" 
 Colt is one hot cowboy who never really wanted more than a one-night stand and Mel is looking for stability and a happy ending. Can they make their incredible chemistry last? Rising Assets is a hot, sexy and fairly quick read featuring a bunch of Alpha males who know how to take charge. I absolutely loved the characters and the storyline. The ending left me breathless and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Zanetti!

"Picture Perfect is, well, a perfect contemporary romance that had me hooked from the very first page! Every once in a while, I come across a book that gives me memorable characters (Hello, Landon!), fantastic, steamy sex scenes, and a storyline that I actually care about. Skye is a smart, hardworking girl who comes from a privileged background but has a very strong work ethic and does not trade in on her family's name. Enter Landon, her driven, very sexy and gorgeous boss, who is actually a nice guy, and realizes that an office romance might it be such a great idea. 
 Elisabeth Grace is an author to watch. She made me really care about Skye and Landon and their chemistry was HOT but their relationship and emotional connection was beautifully developed and explosive. And I absolutely loved how neither of the characters were really a stereotype, they each made mistakes, had insecurities and seemed very real. And Landon, OMG, did I mention he is my new Book Boyfriend!? 
 ""Every day I got a better idea of what a treasure the woman sitting across from me was. I just had to figure out what I was going to do about it. What kind of idiot discovered hidden treasure and then threw it back into the sea?"" 
 This is a sexy, engaging, perfectly written contemporary romance, and I can't wait to read more books by Elisabeth Grace!!

"Fantastic story for fans of dark romance!! 
 Torrent took me by surprise and didn't let go of my heart until the last word. I need Book #2! Rafe is one of the most dangerous but most sympathetic characters I've come across in a long time. I can absolutely see why Alex has been in love with him since she was a young girl. She has lived a very rough life, perfect from the outside but tortured behind closed doors. She has had to endure unimaginable abuse, both emotional and physical. 
 Heed the warnings on this book, the story is a rough one, but it is incredibly well-written, totally sexy and has a fantastic, creative plot. I loved the dual POV's which were a great way to garner sympathy for even an unsympathetic character. This is a story of obsession, lust, love and revenge, and I loved every word. Gemma James has now become a 1-click author for me. She has created a world that I did not want to leave once I finished Torrent, and isn't that the best form of escapism? 
 The ending will leave you reeling and dying for the next book in this series. Not sure I can wait until release and I have already ordered the next book! I am not giving anything away as far as the plot goes because Torrent should be enjoyed without knowing any plot spoilers. Grab this one if you are a fan of dark, sexy reads with a strong Alpha male, you will not be disappointed.

"4.5 SMOKING HOT stars!! 
 Um...wow...what did I just read? If It Drives is hands-down my favorite book in the Market Garden series. This story focuses on ""Red Tie guy"", the wealthy banker James Harcourt. 
 His driver Cal has a crush on James, and wants to figure out why James keeps going back to Market Garden when Cal is available and literally right in front of his face. One night they cross over the employer/employee line, and what a night it is! But something seems lacking, and Cal feels that he can't quite give James what he really needs. Cal then embarks on a journey to explore his own Dom side and he and James have some smoking hot scenes together. But will James realize that Cal wants more than meaningless, one-night stands? 
 If It Drives turned into a quite tender and lovely romance between Cal and James in between all the scorching hot scenes. I absolutely loved the development of their Dominant/submissive relationship and did I mention the sex scenes BURN UP up the page? I also loved the emotional connection between the characters, and Cal's inner dialogue. He came across as surprisingly thoughtful and sweet, an interesting mix with his Dom tendencies.

"Tessa Bailey is known for writing the dirtiest-talking Alphas around. This book was released under Entangled Embrace, so it's not quite as dirty but I absolutely loved it! This is Willa and Shane's story. Willa first appeared in 'Protecting What's His', from the author's Line of Duty series, and I have been looking forward to her story ever since we met Ginger's younger sister. 
 Willa has won a photography contest and the prize is a trip to Ireland. She has broken up with her boyfriend and is tortured over whether she did the right thing. She is met at the airport by her ride to the bed-and-breakfast, none other than the handsome, sexy and apparently very angry Shane. He is none to happy to be burdened with fetching Willa from the airport and they immediately argue. She stands up to him, which most people do not do, and fireworks ensue. 
 Unfixable is a sexy, layered and nuanced story that captured my attention from the beginning to end. Tortured, sexy Irishman with a soft heart? Check. Beautifully described Irish locales? Check. Troubled, insecure and beautiful heroine? Check! Add some really hot and sexy times and you have a perfect romance novel. 
 The characters are all incredibly well-written, Shane and Willa both have issues that they must come to terms with, and above it all, this book has real heart. I absolutely love Tessa Bailey's books and will read anything this woman writes.

"4.5 stars!! Sweet Filthy Boy is the first book in Wild Seasons, a new series from these authors, and if the next books are anything like this one, this will be an AMAZING series! I really didn't expect to love Sweet Filthy Boy as much as I did, but the story and the characters drew me right in and this book far exceeded my expectations. 
 This book starts out with a twist and builds from there. Mia and her friends go to Las Vegas after college graduation as a gift from the parents of one of the friends. Mia is determined to let loose for a weekend before she follows her father's wishes and heads off the graduate business school in Boston. She gets more than she bargained for after one wild night with the gorgeous, sexy but oh-so-sensitive Ansel, who is visiting from France. 
 Mia decides to spend the summer with Ansel in France. This book really transports the reader to the different locales and I loved being lost in the story. Las Vegas, San Diego, Paris... the cities each almost became another character in the book. I absolutely fell in love with Ansel and the sexy times in this story are SMOKING HOT, off the charts! The writing is perfection and I want to get to know all of the characters better! 
 I really wasn't sure how this book was going to turn out, and I was glued to the pages until the very end. I loved this book, I loved Ansel and can't wait for more in this series!

"This is an unexpectedly funny book with lots of the detail that Nelle is known for. We are transported to the not-always-glam television entertainment business in Los Angeles for a very funny, very hot and sexy story about a smart heroine, who is engaged to a blah guy who might not be the right guy for her. She meets our hero Blake in a very humorous way and he really throws her for a loop. 
 I like how Nelle's heroines are always smart, professional women who aren't shrinking violets. I also like how she always give the reader a very detailed sense of place and setting for her books. I am a sucker for books set in California! There is also a very funny scene in this book that I must say I don't think I've seen before in erotic romance books and which I enjoyed immensely. 
 THAT MAN is highly recommended if you want a funny, sexy, fairly quick read with a strong heroine. And, Jennifer and Blake's story continues in THAT MAN 2 which is already released!",1,4,1,179,41.04,69.35,29.07,99.0,19.89,14.53,88.83,69.27,57.54,15.08,10.61,3.91,1.12,0.56,3.35,0.0,4.47,14.53,8.38,0.56,12.29,8.38,9.5,5.59,1.68,13.41,6.7,1.12,2.23,1.68,0.0,0.56,11.17,1.12,10.06,2.79,1.12,1.12,1.68,0.56,2.79,0.0,11.17,10.61,0.56,4.47,3.91,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.08,5.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.23,1.68,11.73,0.0,0.0,5.03,2.79,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.56,5.03,1.12,0.0,3.91,0.56,0.0,1.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.68,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.03,8.38,0.0,0.56,6.15,0.56,0.0,1.12,3.35,2.79,8.38,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.29,3.91,3.35,0.0,1.12,2.79,1.12,0
"I liked this installment better than the first one! Andrew still can't get enough of Aubrey and she is still dealing with her very dysfunctional family. This is a quick read and sat on my currently-reading shelf forever. I can't wait for the next installment because this one ends abruptly and I'm dying to know what happened to Andrew to make him so screwed up when it comes to women and relationships. Loved the sex scenes, this is a quick and steamy read with good character development. Hurry up Whitney!!! I'm dying here!!",1,4,1,93,32.41,14.43,66.26,84.42,13.29,15.05,84.95,70.97,55.91,15.05,8.6,5.38,0.0,0.0,3.23,0.0,6.45,16.13,5.38,3.23,12.9,7.53,6.45,9.68,2.15,18.28,6.45,4.3,2.15,1.08,1.08,0.0,7.53,1.08,6.45,1.08,2.15,2.15,0.0,0.0,3.23,0.0,4.3,4.3,0.0,2.15,2.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.45,1.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.38,0.0,0.0,3.23,1.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,0.0,3.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,2.15,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,1.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.68,5.38,0.0,1.08,5.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.68,4.3,8.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.2,4.3,1.08,0.0,6.45,4.3,1.08,0
"This novella gets 5 stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue, and 1 star for the often laughable supporting storyline. There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV's but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.",5,3,1,126,70.33,13.82,29.04,20.23,25.2,23.02,84.92,69.84,54.76,10.32,3.17,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.14,19.05,11.11,3.17,11.11,7.14,7.94,5.56,0.79,11.9,11.11,2.38,0.79,0.79,0.0,0.0,11.9,1.59,10.32,0.0,0.79,2.38,0.79,3.97,0.79,0.0,7.94,3.17,3.17,3.17,0.79,0.79,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.79,5.56,3.97,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.38,0.79,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.79,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.0,6.35,11.9,0.0,0.79,9.52,0.79,0.0,0.79,3.17,1.59,3.97,0.79,0.79,0.0,0.79,0.0,0.0,10.32,3.97,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.79,2.38,0
